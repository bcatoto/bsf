        "abstract": "Soybeans in its natural form have a little direct use as a food due to its poor digestibility as well as beany taste and flavour. Fermentation; however, can improve the eating and nutritional qualities of soybeans. Fermented soybean foods have been an intricate part of oriental diet for a long time. Bacillus subtilis dominated traditionally fermented soyfoods have typical taste, texture and aroma which is popular in Asian and African countries. B. subtilis fermentation of soaked and cooked soybeans brings many physico-chemicals and sensory changes that make it highly digestible and nutritious. This paper reviews various facets of B. subtilis fermented traditional foods, properties of fermenting organisms, preparation of such fermented foods, changes in chemical composition and nutritional properties and improving the quality of these foods.",

        "abstract": "Select lactic acid bacteria (LAB); Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei and L. acidophilus were targeted for enhancing bioactives and flavor volatiles of cashew apple juice (CAJ) that is an underutilized byproduct from cashew nut processing in Tropical countries. Results indicated the vitamin C and phenolic metabolites such as condensed tannin can be increased at certain stages such as at 12 h over the 48 h fermentation period. Whereas antioxidant activity based on DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity generally decreased from initial unfermented stage range of (75%–95%) to consistently in the 50% range by 48 h of fermentation and this follows the decrease in viable counts. The fermentation process increased the condensed tannin contents in CAJ whereas hydrolysable tannins decreased. In this study the changes in flavor volatile types were also analyzed over the course of CAJ fermentation. The results indicated that LAB changed the flavor profiles of fermented CAJ and overall the fruity odor decreased, but the whiskey and acid odor increased. These results provide the foundation to further target the functional benefits of LAB-induced fermented CAJ for further human, animal, and plant health applications",

        "abstract": "This work studies the interactions, thermodynamics, phase behaviour, and rheology of mucin/gelatin binary mixtures. Addition of gelatin in mucin solutions at pH 7 leads to aggregation and phase separation, while such phenomena are not observed at lower pH values. Zeta potential measurements show that electrostatic interactions lead to the formation of soluble complexes between the mucin and gelatin at pH 3. However, steric exclusions are the prime candidates for inducing any interactions between the two macromolecular populations at pH 7. Fluorimetry shows two binding regimes for mucin/gelatin mixtures at pH 3, and one at pH 7. ΔG show higher negative value at pH 7, as compared to pH 3; this can account for the tendency of gelatin to flocculate in the presence of mucin at neutral environments but not in acidic ones. The Trouton ratio (ratio of extensional to shear viscosity) is low at pH 3, but unusually high at pH 7 due to the aggregated structures. The above highlight the molecular events leading to the flow of gelatin-based foods during oral processing.",

Various concentrations of TPC-W (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 wt%) were then used as an emulsifier stabilize to oilin-water emulsions prepared using medium chain triglycerides. The emulsion stabilized using 2.0 wt% TPC-W remained relatively constant during 10 days of storage at 25 �C, with the mean particle diameter (MPD) (d32) and zeta potential increasing from 1.8 to 2.4 μm and from 19.8 to 18.9 mV, respectively. The effect of metal ions (Naþ, Ca2þ, and Al3þ) and the pH value on the stability of the 2.0 wt% TPC-W emulsions was also studied at 25 �C for 10 days. The system remained stable at Naþ concentrations between 0.10 and 0.50 mol/L and Ca2þ concentrations below 0.030 mol/L, with little change in the MPD (d32) of the emulsion droplets. When Al3þ was added to the emulsion system, the MPD (d32) of the emulsion changed significantly; the addition of 0.001 mol/L Al3þ increased the MPD (d32) from 2.2 to 5.8 μm.

        "abstract": "The effects of thermomechanical treatment and guar gum (GG) addition on the in vitro digestibility of rice starch have been investigated. Rice starch added with GG at concentrations of 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, or 0.10 g/100 g (wet basis) was subject to a micro-extrusion process. The in vitro digestibility, predicted glycemic index (pGI), and multi-scale structures (granule, lamellar, crystalline, and molecular structures) were examined. Micro-extruded rice starch (MERS) with GG presented reduced digestion rate and pGI, a higher degree of structural ordering, and altered crystalline, single-helical and double-helical structures. Using Pearson correlation analysis, the relationships among extrusion, the molecular interaction and multi-scale structure, and the digestibility were established. The content of resistant components (RC) was positively correlated with crystallinity (r = 0.836, p < 0.05), fractal dimension (r = 0.966, p < 0.05), A-type crystallinity (r = 0.954, p < 0.01), V-type crystallinity (r = 0.987, p < 0.05), R1045/1022 (r = 0.987, p < 0.05), single-helix content (r = 0.897, p < 0.05), and double-helix content (r = 0.991, p < 0.01); and was negatively correlated with pGI (r = −0.947, p < 0.05). Overall, this study showed that thermomechanical treatment assisted the complexation of GG with starch, which could be an effective means to improve the resistant properties of rice starch.",

These pectic fractions differed on their type and degree of esterification (amidated (AHG 30%), low (HG 30%) and high methyl esterified fractions (HG 70%)) and on the pattern of esterification (blockwise (HG-B 70%) vrs random (HG-R 70%)). The binding constant (Ka) and the associated thermodynamic parameters determined showed weak noncovalent interactions, particularly due to electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effect. The degree and the type of esterification of each pectic fractions had a significant effect on the binding constants determined by ITC and NMR experiments. The binding constants ranged from 102 to 104 M−1, with the highest Ka value observed for the interaction between cy3glc and low methylesterified fraction, followed by the amidated fraction. Pectic fractions with a higher degree of methyl esterification, resulted on lower binding affinities, with these interactions being mostly driven by hydrophobic effect compared to enthalpy. The different binding affinities could be correlated with anthocyanins colour impact, as a higher red colour intensity could be observed for a cy3glc model solution fortified with a low methylated fraction. However, this colour improvement was not observed for amidated fraction, presumably due to charge repulsive forces, lowering the stability of the flavylium cation.",

The study included 150 male 1-day-old Ross 308 chickens, which were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments (50 replications each) and kept in individual cages. From days 1 to 16, all birds received only the basal diets. From days 17 to 21, the control group received still the basal diet, but for the two other groups, 20% of basal diet was replaced by raw or extruded peas. Furthermore, the groups receiving raw or extruded peas were divided into five subgroups of 10 animals each, where the diets contained one of the five pea samples of the same cultivar grown at different locations, respectively. On days 19 and 20, excreta were individually collected, and then all chickens were sacrificed and ileal digesta were sampled for determination of ileal digestibility, which was calculated by the difference method. Extrusion of pea seeds decreased the contents of crude fibre, acid and neutral detergent fibre, trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), phytic P and resistant starch (RS) (p ≤ 0.05), but increased the contents of apparent metabolisable energy (AMEN) by approximately 2.25 MJ/kg dry matter (DM). Furthermore, extrusion improved the DM and crude protein digestibility significantly by about 21.3% and 11.6%, respectively. Similar results were observed for the digestibility of all analysed amino acids. In conclusion, extrusion markedly influenced the chemical composition of peas, reduced their contents of phytic P, TIA and RS and consequently had a positive impact on nutrient digestibility and AMEN values.",

The total duration of the study was 23 d, and the study involved two phases - accommodation phase (d 1-18) and experimental phase (d 18-23).3. The effect of protease on response traits was not consistent between the legumes. The enzyme increased the digestibility of some AAs in the pea (arginine, leucine, phenylalanine, histidine, tyrosine, alanine, and proline), faba bean (lysine, arginine, glycine, and asparagine), and yellow lupin diets (lysine, valine, and serine), but this effect was not observed in the narrow-leaved lupin diet. The change in AMEN values due to protease addition was only statistically significant for the pea diet (P < 0.05), whereas in the case of other legume species, the difference was insignificant (P > 0.05).4. Exogenous protease increased the digestibility of AAs present in pea, faba bean, and yellow lupin seeds but not in narrow-leaved lupin diets.

The experiment was conducted with 480 broiler chicks divided into 6 dietary treatments, including a maize-soybean meal control diet (CON) and 5 experimental diets containing 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 g/kg WLM. During the period from d 0 to 35, birds fed on 200 or higher WLM/kg were characterised by lower body weight gain and feed intake than CON. The use of 150 g of WLM/kg increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to CON treatment. Apparent metabolisable energy corrected to zero N balance (AMEN) and apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter, ether extract, crude protein and starch, linearly decreased as WLM increased from 0 to 300 g/kg. There was a quadratic effect of WLM dose on sialic acid excretion. A strong negative linear correlation was found between the excretion of sialic acid and AMEN. The viscosity of ileal digesta was linearly increased as WLM increased. The effect of WLM dose on ileum villus height (VH) was linear, while that on ileum villus area (VA) was quadratic. Both parameters decreased as WLM increased from 0 to 300 g/kg. In conclusion, the use of over 150 g/kg of WLM in broiler diets depressed performance results. However, depression of nutrient utilisation was only observed when 250 or 300 g/kg of WLM was used.",

        "abstract": "3D printing is a new promising technology capable of creating intricate food shapes. To stabilize the mechanical properties of the complex printed food it may require support structures. The 3D shape of chocolate was designed with different support structures (cross support, parallel support and no support) and its effect on the snapping properties was investigated. This study also determined the relationship between the physical properties of chocolate used for printing and the quality of the printed 3D constructs. The dimensions (wall thickness, height, and diameter), weight as well as physical properties (melting properties, flow behaviour, snap ability) of the 3D printed chocolate were evaluated. The nozzle temperature before deposition was maintained at 32 °C in order to extrude the melted state of the sample as the flow behaviour curves indicated that the melting of chocolate started between 28 °C to 30 °C. Incorporation of Magnesium Stearate (MgST) in the chocolate formulation aid in material lubrication and increase flow efficiency during deposition. Results showed that there was a minor difference between the predetermined diameter and the actual output diameter for each sample suggesting similarity between the printed 3D structure and the pre-designed 3D model. Wall thickness of printed item varied along the height due to uneven deposition of chocolate as the layer height increased. The breaking strength of the sample was strongly related to the additional support structure, with 3D chocolate with cross support structure requiring the highest force (N) to break the sample.\n\nIndustrial relevance\nThe development and production of food with 3-Dimensional printing (3DP) technology has potential to create and produce food in a more advanced format that will be a new paradigm shift in the food industry. Through 3D printing, personalised food can be created in terms of shape and nutritional composition. To firmly establish this promising technology as a powerful tool for engineering food it is required a thorough understanding of the supply ingredients and strategies to enhance printability. This study demonstrates the use of flow enhancer and inclusion of support structure in the designed shape were key factors influencing printability capacity of chocolate (edible ink chosen as a model).",

        "abstract": "Background and objectives: Consumption of food barley is increasing due to its health and nutritional benefits. Whole grain flours of two hulled barley varieties, Lyon and Muir, and three hull‐less barley varieties, Havener, 09WA‐265.12, and Meg's Song, were extruded with a co‐rotating twin‐screw extruder. The impacts of feed moisture, screw speed, and die temperature on functional properties of extrudates were investigated. Findings: Expansion ratio (ER) of barleys was slightly lower compared to the reported numbers for cereals such as corn. Hulled varieties showed significantly higher ER compared to the hull‐less varieties. Havener was the only hull‐less variety having comparable ER with hulled varieties and moderate levels of ß‐glucan. ER correlated positively with water solubility index (r = 0.680, p < 0.01), specific mechanical energy (r = 0.633, p < 0.01), and negatively with unit density (r = −0.729, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Hulled varieties are better suited for extrusion expansion. Feed moisture and die temperature had a strong influence on expansion, while screw speed showed marginal effects. Significance and novelty: Understanding the properties of hulled and hull‐less barley extrudates will enable process industry to utilize them for the development of novel extruded foods, while taking advantage of their nutritional values.",

While there is no doubt that one's ability of texture discrimination depends on various oral physiological characteristics of the individual, it is not yet clear how tongue surface temperature affects the sensitivity of texture discrimination. This study was designed to test the effects of tongue surface temperature on oral tactile sensitivity and viscosity discrimination. A total of twenty healthy subjects (ten females and ten males; mean age: 25 ± 1 yrs, mean body mass index: 20.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2) participated in this study. Water at different temperatures (0, 20, 37, and 45 °C) and capsaicin solutions (5,10, and 20 ppm) were used as physical and chemical stimulations to alter tongue temperature, respectively. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, Bio-Thesiometer, and Touch-Test®Two-point discriminator were respectively applied to assess the tongue's sensitivity of light touch, vibratory perception and two-point discrimination before and after treatment with both physical and chemical stimuli. Maltodextrin solutions were used for oral viscosity discrimination. Tongue's vibratory perception thresholds varied significantly (P < 0.01), indicating an increase of 0.6 × 10−6cm in vibratory perception threshold when tongue surface temperature decreased from 33 °C to 20 °C, while light touch and two-point discrimination thresholds remained unchanged. The application of capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 ppm) produced an increase in tongue surface temperature but did not affect oral tactile sensitivity. Viscosity discrimination increased both after rinsing the mouth with warm water and capsaicin application (20 ppm). Capsaicin (20 ppm) increased tongue temperature by 1.3 °C and lead to a decrease in viscosity discrimination threshold from 34.7% to 20.2%. After stimulation with water at 37 °C and 45 °C, the tongue temperature increased by 3 °C (from 34.2 °C to 37.2 °C), while threshold of viscosity discrimination decreased from 28.1% to 23.1%. When water was used to change tongue surface temperature, a positive correlation was found between vibratory perception sensitivity and viscosity discrimination ability, suggesting the capacity of discriminating viscosity might depend on vibratory perception sensitivity.",

First, we explored the change in foam volume with time. Results showed that foam stability (FS) increased with the increasing of bulk concentration of TA. The number of actual aggregates in foam lamella which accounts for improved foam stability was well quantified using optical microscopy and CLSM. Besides, the surface dilatational rheological properties indicated that the formation of the SC/TA complex increased the elastic modulus (Ed) of the air/water interface, which is useful for inhibiting collapse. Finally, adsorbed proteins were obtained by freeze-drying method and proteins were labeled and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-ESI–MS/MS) for protein identification and quantification. The results showed that the significant improvement in the foam stability of the system is due to the addition of TA to increase the amount of κ-casein adsorbed on the interface, resulting in a more elastic air/water interface. The results presented in this study should provide detailed quantitative information of the interfacial layer, and will facilitate the application of the formed protein/polyphenol complex as functional ingredients in food and non-food systems.",

In this research, ovalbumin (OVA) and ovalbumin-inulin glycoconjugates with different Maillard reaction times were used to stabilize pomegranate seed oil emulsions and their impact on physicochemical stability and oxidative stability of the products was investigated. The OVA-inulin glycoconjugate produced on 10th day of Maillard reaction has exhibited significantly higher conjugation efficiency, lower surface hydrophobicity and lower surface tension than other glycoconjugates. The secondary conformation of OVA and conjugates determined by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy has remarkably changed. The reduction in intensity of Trp-fluorescence observed in glycated proteins with inulin indicated that the glycation affected partially the side chains of protein in tertiary structure through the Maillard reaction without great disruption of native structure. The emulsion stabilized by OVA-inulin glycoconjugate obtained by 10 days Maillard reaction has shown the best physicochemical stability. Compared with the OVA emulsion, the oxidative stability of the glycated OVA emulsion system was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Fatty acid profile results also confirmed that OVA-inulin glycoconjugates were able to prevent the pomegranate seed oil from oxidation. It is suggested that the inulin attached to OVA by glycation played a vital role in physicochemical stability and oxidative stability of pomegranate seed oil emulsions.",

A non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior was observed in all the mucilage samples. However, mucilage aerogels had a higher viscosity than the mucilage powder due to higher polysaccharide purity. Mucilage aerogels showed comparable rheological properties to xanthan gum at the same concentration (2%, w/w).

        "abstract": "The suppression mechanism of L-arginine (Arg) in fish myosin heat-induced aggregation was investigated in this work. The hydrodynamic radius determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the turbidity of a myosin solution decreased in a dose-dependently manner with Arg after heating, especially in a solution without pH modification (P < 0.05). The surface hydrophobicity of myosin exhibited the same trend as that for hydrodynamic radius and turbidity (P < 0.05). The myosin secondary structures clearly changed with Arg concentration during heating (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that positively-charged Arg could form ionic interactions with negatively charged myosin, as well as promote repulsion between myosin molecules induced by higher pH values. Furthermore, the resultant hydrogen bonding observed indicated that, in addition to Arg having ionic linkage effects, the specific structure of Arg played an important role in the suppression of myosin aggregation. Essentially, Arg markedly disturbed the hydrogen bonds of the myosin backbone and formed new hydrogen bonds with myosin molecules via two amino groups (-NH2), which are part of the guanidinium moiety of Arg, preferentially hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of myosin molecules. This work provides support for using Arg as an additive to modify the texture of fish products to produce liquid and semiliquid food suitable for the elderly consumers in an aging society.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigated the properties of egg white protein hydrolysate (EH) prepared from alkali-induced egg white gel as an oil-in-water emulsion stabilizer. The physicochemical properties of EH, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), surface hydrophobicity, particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index were investigated. Meanwhile, the microstructure, emulsion stability, oil oxidative stability, in vitro digestive stability and antioxidant activity of emulsion prepared by EH were evaluated. Results suggested that the surface hydrophobicity of EH decreased due to the destruction of hydrophobic groups, and the particle size of most hydrolysates ranged from 124.24 to 197.7 nm, except neutrase and alcalase hydrolysates. FTIR revealed that the strength of each peak increased significantly after hydrolysis owing to the break of structure and peptide bond. Most EH-stabilized emulsions were stable against droplets aggregation as influenced by temperature, and emulsion prepared from trypsin hydrolysate exhibited better ionic strength and storage stability. Emulsion stabilized by trypsin and alcalase hydrolysates delayed the lipids oxidation during storage. Droplet aggregation occurred to emulsions after in vitro digestion due to the destruction of the emulsion structure and the accumulation of proteins and lipids, and the release rate of free fatty acids ranged from 55.72% to 77.29% in the 2 h vitro intestine digestion for six different emulsions. Additionally, most digested EH-stabilized emulsion enhanced its ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS and O2 free radical, owing to the formation of antioxidant peptides. These results suggest that EH can be as a potential stabilizer for emulsions, especially trypsin hydrolysate, and possesses antioxidant properties after digestion.",

High consumption of calcium propionate can lead to several health problems. This study aims to develop a fast and simple semiquantitative method based on color complex formation for the determination of calcium propionate in a bread sample. A redebrown complex was obtained from the reaction of ferric ammonium sulfate and propionate anion. The product was rapidly formed and easily observed with the concentration of propionate anion >0.4 mg/mL. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was also developed and validated for comparison. Twenty-two bread samples from three markets near Bangkok were randomly selected and assayed for calcium propionate using the above two developed methods. The results showed that 19/22 samples contained calcium propionate >2000 mg/kg. The results of the complex formation method agreed with the HPLC method.",

Samples are pretreated through liquideliquid extraction and solidphase extraction. This method is time consuming and requires the intensive use of solvents. To improve analytical efficiency and reduce costs, our study incorporated QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) techniques to establish a new method of multiresidue analysis of b-agonists in animal muscle and viscera. The pretreatment time was shortened and solvent usage was minimized. The modified analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LCeMS/MS) and quantification was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients of the tissue calibration curve were higher than 0.99 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1 ppb. The average recoveries in spiked samples varied from 70% to 120%, and the relative difference between duplicated analysis results was lower than 10%. On the basis of the results, the proposed method was concluded to be an appropriate procedure for determining the presence of b-agonists, and demonstrated the advantages of high recovery rates in spiked samples, high precision, reduced analysis time and solvent usage, and lower costs",

In this study, initial sugar and nitrogen (urea) concentrations in sweet sorghum stem juice (SSJ) were optimized for high PE (≥ 10%, v/v), QP, (≥ 2.5 g/L·h) and SC (≥ 90%) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae SSJKKU01. Then, repeated-batch fermentations under normal gravity (NG) and high gravity (HG) conditions were studied.\n\nResults\nThe initial sugar at 208 g/L and urea at 2.75 g/L were the optimum values to meet the criteria. At the initial yeast cell concentration of ~ 1 × 108 cells/mL, the PE, QP and SC were 97.06 g/L, 3.24 g/L·h and 95.43%, respectively. Repeated-batch fermentations showed that the ethanol production efficiency of eight successive cycles with and without aeration were not significantly different when the initial sugar of cycles 2 to 8 was under NG conditions (~ 140 g/L). Positive effects of aeration were observed when the initial sugar from cycle 2 was under HG conditions (180–200 g/L). The PE and QP under no aeration were consecutively lower from cycle 1 to cycle 6. Additionally, aeration affected ergosterol formation in yeast cell membrane at high ethanol concentrations, whereas trehalose content under all conditions was not different.\n\nConclusion\nInitial sugar, sufficient nitrogen and appropriated aeration are necessary for promoting yeast growth and ethanol fermentation. The SSJ was successfully used as an ethanol production medium for a high level of ethanol production. Aeration was not essential for repeated-batch fermentation under NG conditions, but it was beneficial under HG conditions.",

        "abstract": "The impact of fermentation (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763) on the bioaccessibility of lycopene in a model tomato juice was examined. The physicochemical and structural properties of the tomato tissue were determined after fermentation and the bioaccessibility of lycopene was monitored using a simulated gastrointestinal tract. A lycopene concentration of 45.1 mg/100 g was obtained under optimal fermentation conditions. The cell walls of the tomato cells were hydrolyzed and disrupted by fermentation. Cell disruption decreased the pectin content and reduced the tissue fragment size, thereby reducing gravitational separation and facilitating lycopene release. The lycopene bioaccessibility in the tomato juices increased in the following order: unfermented (8.5%) < fermented (11.4%) < unfermented-emulsified (13.6%) < fermented-emulsified (22.7%). These effects were attributed to a combination of greater tomato tissue disruption and enhanced mixed micelle formation.

        "title": "Consumer acceptance of insect-based alternative meat products in Western countries",
        "abstract": "During the past few years, entomophagy has been increasing in significance. As insects are generally high in protein, they are principally considered as meat substitutes. Nevertheless, in Western countries, meat substitute consumption is actually very low, principally due to food neophobia and poor sensory qualities in comparison with meat. In insect particular case, food neophobia is clearly high. To reduce insect food neophobia, previous studies suggest to insert invisible insect in food preparation and/or to associate them with known flavors. In this study, a survey on entomophagy perception and hedonic tests were realized to assess the level of sensory-liking of hybrid insect-based burgers (beef, lentils, mealworms and beef, mealworms and lentils). Participants’ overall liking of the four burgers differed between genders and was influenced by burger appearance and taste. Women clearly preferred beef burger appearance, whereas men preferred the appearance of beef and insect-based burgers. Concerning insect-based burger taste, participants (men and women) rated it intermediately, between that of the beef and lentil burger, with a preference for the mealworm and beef burger. Results also showed that people with previous entomophagy experience was limited but that they gave globally higher ratings to all preparations. In conclusion, insect tasting sessions are important to decrease food neophobia, as they encourage people to ‘‘take the first step” and become acquainted with entomophagy. Nevertheless, insect integration into Western food culture will involve a transitional phase with minced or powdered insects incorporated into ready-to-eat preparations, as people are not ready to add insects to their diets in ‘‘whole form.”",

The snacks, which were presented as pictures in an online survey, differed in their degree of processing of the insect ingredient: tortilla chips made of cricket flour (“flour”), tortilla chips containing deep-fried cricket bits (“bits”), a snack consisting of tortilla chips and deep-fried crickets (“mix”), and deep-fried crickets (“crickets”). Swiss respondents (N = 428) made 39 emotional evaluations, rated willingness to eat and expected liking of the presented products. Each participant evaluated the same non-insect-containing snack (within-subjects design) and one of four insect-containing snacks (between-subjects design). Results showed that the insect snacks evoked various negative emotional expectations that went beyond expectations of disgust. Positive emotional expectations were less expected to occur. Furthermore, expectations related to disgust/uneasiness, inertia/dissatisfaction, and positive emotional evaluations were significant predictors of willingness to eat. The degree of processing of the insect ingredient partly influenced the ratings, with the “mix” product being assessed more negatively than the “flour” or “bits” products. The “cricket” product was rated more positive than expected.\n\nThe research indicates that in the development and marketing of insect food, efforts should be undertaken not only to eliminate initial negative expectations of disgust and dissatisfaction but also to generate positive emotional expectations. We suggest the marketing of snacks containing processed insect ingredients will be more promising, and selling whole insects alone is more preferable to selling a mixed snack. Regardless of the degree of processing of the insect ingredient, the results suggest that marketing activities must contend with a large emotional barrier.",

        "abstract": "Insects are energy-efficient and sustainable sources of animal protein in a world with insufficient food resources to feed an ever-increasing population. However, much of the western world refuses to eat insects because they perceive them as disgusting. This research finds that both animal reminder disgust and core disgust reduced people's willingness to attend a program called “Bug Appetit \u0001 ” in which insects were served as food. Additionally, people who were low in sensitivity to animal reminder disgust were more willing to attend this program after having been primed to think about cooking. Cooking is a process by which raw ingredients are transformed into finished products, reducing the “animalness” of meat products that renders them disgusting. Sensitivity to core disgust did not interact with cooking to influence willingness to attend the program. While prior research has emphasized that direct education campaigns about the benefits of entomophagy (the consumption of insects) can increase willingness to attend events at which insect-based food is served, this is the first demonstration that indirect priming can have a similar effect among a subset of the population",

First, near-spontaneous nocturnal chow meal size (MS), intermeal intervals (IMI) length and satiety ratios (SR ¼ MS/IMI) were measured after infusion of saline, 0.025 or 0.5 nmol/kg GLP-1 into the celiac artery (CA, supplying the stomach and upper duodenum), cranial mesenteric artery (CMA, supplying small and all of the large intestine except the rectum), femoral artery (FA, control) or portal vein (PV, control). Second, infusion of 0.5 nmol/kg GLP-1 was tested after pretreatment with the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist exendin-4(3e39) via the same routes. Third, the regional distribution of GLP-1R in the rat GI tract was determined using rtPCR. CA, CMA and FA GLP-1 reduced first MS relative to saline, with the CMA route more effective than the others. Only CMA GLP-1 prolonged the IMI. None of the infusions affected second MS or later eating. CA and CMA GLP-1 increased the SR, with the CMA route more effective than the CA route. CMA exendin-4 (3e39) infusion reduced the effect of CMA GLP-1. Finally GLP-1R expression was found throughout the GI tract. The results suggest that exogenous GLP1 acts in multiple GI sites to reduce feeding under our conditions and that GLP-1R in the area supplied by the CMA, i.e., the small and part of the large intestine, plays the leading role",

        "abstract": "Meat is expensive to produce, making it is essential to understand the importance consumers pay to different meat cuts. Previous research on consumers' meat choices has mainly focused on meat species, while consumer preferences for meat cuts has so far only received limited interest. The aim of this study is to shed some light into this relatively unexplored area by answering four research questions. First, this study intends to show the relative importance meat cuts play in relation to other extrinsic product attributes. Secondly, this paper looks into differences in choice criteria between regular and special occasions. Third, consumer segments that differ in their preferences and beef purchase are identified, and, finally, the meat purchase portfolios of these segments are revealed. A stated preference methodology of a discrete choice experiment with cut-specific prices covering several meat cuts simultaneously is proposed to answer the research questions. The sample consists of 1500 respondents representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender and geographic location The results shows that meat cut is the most important factor when choosing bovine meat followed by quality certification (origin), production technique, the type of breed and price. In terms of consumption occasions, we observe significantly lower price sensitivity for marbled steaks and cutlets for special occasions compared to normal occasions. Segmentation analysis shows that while the choices of two segments (comprising about 40% of the sample) are mostly driven by extrinsic product attributes, the remaining segments are mostly driven by meat cuts. These varying preferences are also reflected in the purchase portfolios of the different segments, while less variability is detected from a socio-demographic perspective",

Understanding the factors that drive their desire to eat is key to limiting their reactions to available food. This study tested whether individual differences in sensitivity to hedonic food cues are cognitively based and, accordingly, can be regulated by blocking cognitive resources. To this end, one lab study (Study 1; N ¼ 91) and one field study (Study 2; N ¼ 63) measured sensitivity to hedonic food cues using the Power of Food Scale (PFS; Lowe et al., 2009) and assessed participants' appetitive responses to high-calorie food options. To test the role of cognitive elaboration of food cues, participants completed a menu-selection task to induce food cravings and then were free to elaborate those cravings (control group) or were blocked from doing so by cognitive distraction (playing Tetris, solving puzzles; experimental group). Compared to non-sensitive participants, sensitive participants displayed a greater attentional bias to high-calorie food (Study 1), reported stronger cravings (Study 2), and more often chose an unhealthy snack (Studies 1 & 2), but only when they had not been distracted. When distracted, all participants were similarly unresponsive to high-calorie food. This finding suggests that temptation can be effectively controlled by blocking people's cognitive resources, even for people highly sensitive to hedonic food cues.",

This study examines the home food environment factors contributing to the presence of fruit and vegetables at family meals. Methods: Home food inventory (HFI) and survey data were collected from low-income, minority families (n ¼ 120) with children 6e12 years old. Observations from video-recorded family dinner meals, totaling 800 videos, were used to measure the frequency at which fruit and vegetables were served. Multiple regression was used to investigate how the fruit and vegetables in the HFI and other home food environment factors were related to the number of days fruit and vegetables were served at dinner during the observation period. Results: Availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables in the home were each found to be significantly associated with the presence of fruits and vegetables at family dinners. Of the fruit and vegetable categories (i.e., fresh, canned, or frozen), having fresh fruit and vegetables available in the home was found to be most strongly associated with serving fruit and vegetables at dinner, respectively. Higher parent intake of vegetables was associated with the presence of vegetables at dinners, and parent meal planning was associated with the presence of fruit at dinners. Conclusions: Increasing the availability and accessibility of fresh fruit and vegetables in the home may be an effective approach to increasing the presence of fruits and vegetables at family dinners, especially among low-income, minority households. It is also essential to understand why families are not using all fruits and vegetables (e.g., canned and frozen) available in the home for family meals.

We aimed to examine the nutritional value of foods sold in vending machines in a UK University and conduct formative research to investigate differences in food intake and body weight by vending machine use among 137 University students. The nutrient content of snacks and beverages available at nine campus vending machines was assessed by direct observation in May 2014. Participants (mean age 22.5 years; 54% males) subsequently completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess vending machine behaviours and food intake.

Index children aged 4e8 years (n ¼ 69) were videotaped while eating a routine evening meal at home with one sibling present. Encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child were coded from the videotapes. Mothers completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire and the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire. Poisson regression was used to examine the association of maternal Pressure to Eat, Restriction, Monitoring, Verbal Direction, and Coercion with number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child. Models were adjusted for index child's age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and maternal education. Results showed that maternal Pressure to Eat (Rate Ratio (RR): 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19, 1.69), Restriction (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.60), Verbal Direction (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.68, 2.47), and Coercion (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.92) were each positively associated with the number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child. Maternal Monitoring was not associated with the number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child (RR: 0.92, 97% CI: 0.78, 1.09). Findings suggest that maternal behavior during mealtimes may affect the index child indirectly by shaping the behavior of siblings.

Mathematical relationships between TBA values of pork and beef during storage at 4’C. between TBA values and pH and between results obtained by the two procedures for determining TBA values of pork during storage are discussed. The extraction method is an acceptable method for determining TBA values and is easier to use than the distillation method. The TBA test has limiteduse formeatsamples that have been frozen.",

        "abstract": "Fried ground beef contains substances that inhibit mutagenesis in bacteria and the initiation of epidermal carcinogenesis in mice by 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a ]anthracene (DMBA). The inhibitors apparently act at least in part via inhibition of cytochrome P-450 activity. A highly purified fraction that inhibited cytochrome P-450 activity in vitro was isolated by HPLC and characterized by GC—MS, and by UV and proton NMR spectroscopy. The fraction contained four isomeric derivatives of linoleic acid each containing a conjugated double-bond system (designated CLA). Synthetically prepared CLA (containing all four isomers) was tested for anti-initiation activity in the two-stage mouse epidermal carcinogenesis system. Seven days, 3 days and 5 min prior to DMBA application, CLA was applied at doses of 20, 20 and 10mg respectively. Control mice were treated similarly with linoleic acid or solvent (acetone). One week after initiation, and twice weekly thereafter, all mice were treated with 12- O -tetrade-canoylphorbol-13-acetate to effect tumor promotion. There was no difference in tumor incidence or yield between linoleic acid-treated mice and solvent-treated control mice. By contrast, the CLA-treated mice developed only about half as many papillomas and exhibited a lower tumor incidence compared with the control mice.",

        "abstract": "Beef jerky is a convenient, ready-to-eat meat product, but requires processing lethality steps to ensure the safety of the product. Previous outbreaks involving various jerky products have highlighted the risks associated with jerky and the importance of utilizing pathogen interventions during processing. In this study, two alternative interventions were evaluated for reducing pathogen populations during jerky processing. Results demonstrated that high pressure processing (HPP; two treatments of 550 MPa, 60 s) could produce significant (p < 0.05), but variable reductions (6.83 and 4.45 log10 CFU/strip) of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7, respectively, on resulting beef jerky. HPP treatments, however, produced minor reductions (p < 0.05) of Gram-positive pathogens, resulting in reductions of 1.28 and 1.32 log10 CFU/strip of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alternatively, boiling water (100 \u0001 2 C) treatments (20e30 s) used after marination and prior to dehydration, reduced Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus populations >5.0 log10 CFU/strip in resulting beef jerky. Thus, 20 or 30 s boiling water (100 \u0001 2 C) treatments could be effective interventions for commercial jerky processors or home food preservers. Future validation of these processes in-plant could provide processors and regulators with alternative strategies for safe and shelfstable jerky products",

The samples were analysed in order to determine the frequency and extent of aflatoxin contamination, using immuno-affinity column and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with post-column photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection. No aflatoxins were detected in all samples of imported baby cereal and locally processed de-hulled maize flour. However, all locally processed maize based baby foods had aflatoxins above EU maximum tolerable level of 0.1 mg/kg. In 75% of locally processed maize puffs, aflatoxins were detected at levels of up to 2 mg/kg. Peanut based therapeutic foods had aflatoxin level between 1.6 and 2.9 mg/kg, exceeding the EU tolerable maximum level (0.1 mg/kg) set for food for health purposes. Locally processed peanut butters had aflatoxins levels in the range of 34.2e115.6 mg/kg, which was significantly higher than their imported counterparts (<0.2e4.3 mg/kg). Samples of locally processed skinned and de-skinned roasted groundnuts had aflatoxins in range of 0.5e2.5 mg/kg and 0.6e36.9 mg/kg, respectively.

This approach can be used on its own or combined with pressure and temperature (i.e. manothermosonication (MTS)). Microbial inactivation kinetics by sonication remains unclear. In the present study, a central composite response surface model (ccRSM) was used in order to study the effects of temperature (20e52 \u0001C), acoustic intensity (60e120 W/cm2 ) and treatment time (40e240 s) at a constant pressure (225 kPa) by MTS processing on microbial inactivation. Reductions of up to c. 1.6 log CFU/ml were achieved for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Lower inactivation values were reported for Staphylococcus aureus (1.05 log CFU/ml). These inactivation values were achieved using conditions of 36 \u0001C, 90 W/cm2 and 240 s. Inactivation of E. coli by MTS (R2 ¼ 0.90) was described by an exponential curve, whereas inactivation of S. aureus and P. fluorescens by MTS (R2 0.73) were described by a linear trend. The coefficient of determination values were obtained following validation between the theoretical model and the experimental values. Statistical analysis showed that treatment time was the factor with greatest influence on microbial inactivation for all three microorganisms. The present study confirms the suitability of using ccRSM as a tool for investigating and predicting the inactivation of E. coli, S. aureus and P. fluorescens as a function of temperature, acoustic power and treatment time, and may also be useful for predicting inactivation of other microorganisms commonly found in raw milk.",

        "abstract": "At many North American beef packing plants, hot water washes and pasteurizing treatments are used to clean and decontaminate carcasses. The aim of this study was to determine whether reduction in numbers of total Escherichia coli found on beef could be regarded as indicative of the reduction in numbers of verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) resulting from the same heat treatment. Swab samples were collected from hide-on beef carcasses and were enriched for E. coli in E. coli broth supplemented with novobiocin. Suspensions containing cells in the stationary phase were mixed with equal volumes of meat juice medium and the mixtures were not heated or were heated at temperatures between 55 and 70 \u0001C. All preparations were treated with deoxycholate and propidium monoazide (PMA), then DNA was extracted. Real-time PCR was performed using primers targeting the uidA gene for total E. coli, the stx1 and stx2 genes for VTEC, and the eae gene for O157. For samples that were not subjected to heat treatment, cycle threshold (Ct) values were from 13.53 to 17.93 for uidA, 17.94 to 26.77 for stx1, 21.57 to 29.36 for stx2, and 23.53 to 28.31 for eae. Ct values for all genes were higher for heat treated than for not treated portions of samples. Differences between Ct values for not treated and heat treated portions of each sample were 5.06e7.57 for uidA, 4.35 to 7.03 for stx1, 4.49 to 7.12 for stx2 and 4.75 to 6.77 for eae. Differences between the increases of Ct values for pairs of genes in the sample were 0.32e0.83 for uidA and stx1, 0.19e0.57 for uidA and stx2 and 0.31e0.80 for uidA and eae. The maximum change in the ratio of Ct values for uidA and stx1, stx2 or eae as a result of heating corresponded to a change of 0.3 log units, which is less than the 0.5 log units generally considered to be microbiologically significant. Therefore, the findings indicate that reductions as a result of mild or pasteurizing heat treatments of total E. coli populations derived from beef can be regarded as indicative of the reductions in sub-populations of O157-VTEC and total VTEC resulting from the treatments.",

All strains reached counts higher than 104 CFU/cm2 after 5 h at 25 \u0001C. Most strains also showed a biofilm-forming ability higher than S. aureus ATCC 6538 e reference strain in bactericidal standard tests e by crystal violet staining. In addition, it seems that food-processing could have produced a selective pressure and strains with a high biofilm-forming ability were more likely found in highly handled and processed products. The efficacy of the industrial disinfectants benzalkonium chloride (BAC), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and peracetic acid (PAA) against biofilms and planktonic counterparts was also examined in terms of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. Biofilms showed an antimicrobial resistance higher than planktonic cells in all cases. However, no correlation was found between MBEC and MBC, likely due to differences in biofilm extracellular matrix (composition, content and architecture) between strains. BAC resistance increased as biofilms aged. Generally, biofilm formation seemed to attenuate the effect of low temperatures on BAC resistance. PAA was found to be most effective against both biofilms and planktonic cells, followed by NaClO and BAC. Resistance did not follow the same order for each biocide, which remarks the need of using a wide collection of strains in standard tests of bactericidal activity to ensure a proper application of disinfectants. Doses recommended by manufacturers for BAC, PAA and NaClO to disinfect food-contact surfaces were lower than doses for complete biofilm removal (i.e. MBEC) under some environmental conditions common in the food industry, which questions bactericidal standard tests and promotes the search for new strategies for biofilm removal.",

Among these, pistachio (Pistacia vera) kernels which are consumed as snack foods and used as ingredients in confectionery, chocolates, meat products, and ice-cream industries have been reported to cause IgEmediated allergic reactions. Trace amounts of undeclared pistachio allergens can cause serious health risks for food-allergic consumers. In order to provide an appropriate method for the detection of pistachio in food products, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the specific and sensitive detection of pistachio was developed. The sensitivity was investigated on spiked wheat flour samples with defined raw and heat-treated pistachio contents (0.1e100,000 mg kg\u00011 ). The real-time PCR detected pistachio in these mixtures down to the lowest investigated spike level of 0.1 mg kg\u00011 . In addition, analysis of different retail samples from the market was performed to demonstrate the suitability of the assay in the food industry. The real-time PCR results obtained from the analysis of 229 commercial food products revealed 29 that didn’t declare pistachio or traces on the label but were found to contain pistachio. The presented real time PCR method is useful for relatively fast, highly selective, and sensitive detection of pistachio in food samples.",

Five yeast strains were selected with ability to overcome different stressors under HG beer fermentation, showing high fermentability rates, resilience to ethanol stress, low production of foam and hydrogen sulfide, as well as similar flocculation rates to brewer's yeasts. After five fermentation recycles, most strains sustained a viability rate higher than 90% and were able to efficiently accumulate trehalose and glycogen, besides presenting no detectable petite mutants at the final stage. In the sensory analysis, the beers obtained from the five selected strains showed greater aromatic complexity, with predominance of ‘spicy’, ‘dried’ and ‘fresh fruits’ descriptors.

        "abstract": "Caciotta is the name used to define a type of Italian semi-hard cheese Caciotta-type cheese. Due to the short ripening time, pasteurization is necessary to eliminate the potential pathogenic bacteria, which may be present in raw milk, causing also the reduction of ripened cheese flavor. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of a selected wild Lactobacillus paracasei strain experimentally used as adjunct culture to enhance the flavour formation in a short-ripened caciotta-type cheese. An integrated polyphasic approach was used to compare the experimental and control Caciotta produced in a company located in Emilia Romagna region (Italy). It was demonstrated how the L. paracasei 4341 was able to develop in curd and cheese interacting with the acidifying commercial starter. The main acidifying starter species, were differently affected by the presence of the adjunct culture. Streptococcus thermophilus shown comparable behavior in all cheese-making step of control and experimental Caciotta, while Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus, growth was slowed down by the presence of the adjunct culture during the whole ripening time. The higher amount of volatile compounds and organic acids due to the adjunct L. paracasei 4341 lead to a clear differentiation of the experimental Caciotta respect to the control, in terms of aromatic profile, color, texture and sensorial perception.",

        "abstract": "Stabilizers are routinely added during cream cheese manufacture to help prevent syneresis during storage. We investigated how different types of stabilizers affected the texture, rheology, and sensory properties of cream cheese. Cream cheeses were manufactured with 0.33% xanthan gum (XG), locust bean gum (LBG), guar gum (GG), or a combination (CBN) of these 3 stabilizers (0.11% of each). Rheological properties of solutions of the individual stabilizers and their combination (equal amounts) were also determined under conditions similar to the aqueous phase of cream cheese (0.6% gum, 1.8% NaCl, and pH 5). Dynamic small amplitude rheological properties of the cream cheeses were measured during heating from 5 to 80°C at the rate of 1°C/ min and cooling at the same rate (since most cream cheese is hot packed/filled before cooling). Measured rheological parameters included storage modulus (G′) and loss tangent. Hardness of cream cheeses was determined by texture profile analysis. Quantitative spectrum descriptive sensory analysis was also performed. Distinct differences were observed between the rheological properties of solutions of the individual stabilizers and the CBN containing all the stabilizers. Results showed that CBN solution formed a strong, thermally reversible gel due to synergistic interaction between stabilizers, whereas XG solution formed a weak gel that was not greatly affected by temperature. Solutions of LBG and GG behaved rheologically as entangled polymer solutions. In the high-temperature (>35°C) region, cream cheeses made with XG and CBN showed higher G′ values compared with other cream cheeses. The G′ values were higher for XG- and CBN-stabilized cream cheeses than LBG- and GG-stabilized cream cheeses at several temperature regions during the cooling cycle. The CBN-stabilized cream cheeses had higher hardness values than the cream cheeses manufactured with the individual stabilizers. Differences were observed between the sensory attributes of cream cheeses stabilized with CBN and those made with individual stabilizers. At low temperatures, the higher hardness and G′ values of CBN-stabilized cream cheeses could be due to synergistic interaction between XG and galactomannans. The higher elasticity of XG-stabilized cream cheeses at high temperatures could be due to its higher thermal stability. This study showed that the stabilizers added during manufacture of cream cheese affected its texture, rheological, and sensory properties.",

        "abstract": "At the beginning of lactation, high-performing dairy cows often experience a severe energy deficit, which in turn is associated with metabolic stress. Increasing feed intake (FI) or reducing the energy deficit during this period could improve the metabolic stability and thus the health of the animals. Genomic selection for the first time enables the inclusion of this hard-to-measure trait in breeding programs. The objective of the current study was the estimation of genetic parameters and genomic breeding values for FI and energy balance (EB). For this purpose, 1,374 Holstein Friesian (HF) dairy cows from 8 German research farms were phenotyped with standardized FI data protocols. After data editing, phenotypic data of HF comprised a total of 40,012 average weekly FI records with a mean of 21.8 ± 4.3 kg/d. For EB 33,376 average weekly records were available with a mean of 3.20 ± 29.4 MJ of NEL/d. With the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) 1,128 of phenotyped cows were genotyped. Thirty-five female candidates of the HF population were genotyped but not phenotyped. Pedigree information contained sires and dams 4 generations back. The random regression animal model included the fixed effects of herd test week (alternatively, herd group test week), parity, and stage of lactation, modeled by the function according to Ali and Schaeffer (1987). For both the random permanent environmental effect across lactations and the random additive genetic effect, third-order Legendre polynomials were chosen. Additionally, a random permanent environmental cow effect within lactation was included. Analyses for heritabilities, genetic correlations between different lactation stages, and breeding values were estimated using, respectively, pedigree relationships and single-step genomic evaluation, carried out with the DMU software package (Madsen et al., 2013). This allowed for comparison of conventional reliabilities with genomic-assisted reliabilities based on real data, to evaluate the gain of genotyping. Heritability estimates ranged between 0.12 and 0.50 for FI, and 0.15 and 0.48 for EB, and increased toward the end of lactation. Genetic correlations were weak between early and late lactation, with a value of 0.05 for FI and negative with a value of −0.05 for EB. Reliabilities for genomic values of cows for FI and EB ranged between 0.33 and 0.61, and 0.27 and 0.47, respectively. For the genotyped cows without phenotypes, the inclusion of genomic relationship leads to an increase of the average reliability of the breeding value for FI by nearly 9% and for EB by 4%. The results show the possibility of combining pedigree, genotypes, and phenotypes for increasing FI or EB to reduce health and reproductive problems, especially at the beginning of lactation. Nevertheless, the reference population needs to be extended to reach higher breeding value reliabilities.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate production responses to supplementation of 2 AA groups in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Eight cows (99 ± 18 days in milk) were assigned to 4 jugular infusion treatments consisting of saline (CON), methionine plus lysine plus histidine (MKH), isoleucine plus leucine (IL), or MKH plus IL, in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Periods were 18 d in length, comprising 8 d of rest followed by 10 d of jugular infusion. Daily infusion amounts were 21 g of methionine, 38 g of lysine, 20 g of histidine, 50 g of leucine, and 22 g of isoleucine. Cows were ad libitum fed a common diet consisting of 15.2% crude protein and 1.61 Mcal/kg NEL on a dry matter basis that was predicted to meet rumen degradable protein requirements but was 15% deficient in metabolizable protein. Milk and energy-corrected milk yields increased by 2.3 kg/d and 1.9 kg/d, respectively, with infused IL, and no change was observed for MKH. Milk protein concentration increased by 0.13 percentage units for MKH, whereas milk protein yield increased for both MKH and IL by 84 g/d and 64 g/d, respectively. The milk protein yield increase for MKH+IL was 145 g/d versus CON. Gross feed efficiency tended to increase with IL infusion, and N efficiency tended to increase with MKH infusion. Aggregate arterial EAA concentrations less Met, Lys, and His declined by 7.2% in response to MKH infusion. Arterial EAA less Ile and Leu also declined by 6.2% in response to IL infusion. Net total AA (TAA) and EAA uptake by the udder tended to increase in response to MKH infusion, whereas mammary blood flow increased in response to IL infusion, but TAA and EAA net uptakes were unaffected. Apparent udder affinity increased for TAA and EAA less Met, Lys, and His in response to MKH infusion, whereas affinity for EAA less Ile and Leu increased for IL infusion. Venous Met and Leu concentrations increased by 192% and 35% from the MKH and IL infusions, respectively, compared with CON, which indicates that intracellular concentration of these EAA changed substantially. Increases in milk protein yield were observed from 2 groups of amino acids independently and additively, which contradicts the single limiting amino acid theory that a single EAA will limit milk protein yield.",

        "abstract": "Hyperketonemia is a metabolic disease in dairy cows, associated with negative nutrition balance (NNB) induced by low dry matter intake (DMI) and increased nutrient requirements. Hyperketonemia could induce metabolic stress, which might indirectly affect mammary tissue. Autophagy is a highly conserved physiological process that results in the turnover of intracellular material, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis under the challenge of metabolic stress induced by NNB. The aim of this study was to investigate the autophagy status and autophagy-related pathways AMPactivated kinase α (AMPKα) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the mammary glands of dairy cows with hyperketonemia. Cows with hyperketonemia [CWH, n = 10, blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration 1.2 to 3.0 mmol/L] and cows without hyperketonemia (CWOH, n = 10, BHB < 1.2 mmol/L) from 3 to 12 DIM were randomly selected from the herd. The mammary tissue and blood samples were collected from these cows between 0630 and 0800 h, before feeding, at 3 to 12 d in milk. Serum concentrations of glucose, BHB, and fatty acids were determined using an autoanalyzer with commercial kits between 0630 and 0800 h, before feeding. Concentrations of fatty acids, BHB (median and interquartile range: CWH, 2.44 and 1.3, 2.82 mM; CWOH, 0.49 and 0.41, 0.57 mM), and milk fat were greater in CWH. The DMI, glucose concentration, milk production, and milk protein levels were lower in CWH. The mRNA abundance of autophagosome formationrelated gene, beclin 1 (BECN1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3), autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5, ATG7, ATG12, microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3, also called LC3) and sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, also called p62) were greater in the mammary glands of CWH. The protein abundance of LC3-II and phosphorylation level of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) were greater in CWH, but the total ubiquitinated proteins and protein abundance of p62 were lower. Transmission electron microscopy showed an increased number of autophagosomes in the mammary glands of CWH. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AMPKα was greater, but the phosphorylation of mTOR was lower in the mammary glands of CWH. These results indicate that activity of mTOR pathways and autophagy activity, and upregulation of AMPKα, may be response mechanisms to mitigate metabolic stress induced by hyperketonemia in the mammary glands of dairy cows.",

Twenty-seven Holstein-Frisian calves were assigned to 3 groups: the control group without fat added to the diet (CON, n = 9), a group receiving ethyl esters of flax oil (10 g/d) with lyophilized apples (25 g; MRE), or a group receiving flax oil (10 g/d) with lyophilized apples (25 g; MRL). The study was conducted from d 14 to d 42 of life. Intake of MR and feed were recorded daily, and fecal scores, rectal temperature, and body weight were recorded weekly. Laboratory blood tests were conducted every 7 d from d 14 to 42. Supplementation with the formulation containing ethyl esters of flax oil (MRE) positively affected health, average daily weight gain, growth rate, and feed efficiency. Intake of the starter feed was lower in the calves receiving the formulation with flax oil (MRL). The MRE formulations lowered the concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL fraction in blood serum and decreased the total antioxidant capacity (TAS) and levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The MRL formulation increased TAS and GPx levels in blood serum. The MRE treatment limited the circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor. The MRE and MRL preparations lowered the concentration of SFA (C16:0, C18:0, C18:1) in blood serum, and MRE significantly increased levels of α-linolenic acid. The MRE and MRL preparations beneficially affected production and physiological parameters.

The PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ribosomal spacer PCR, RS-PCR) allows a rapid classification of the strains in genotypes and genotypic clusters (CL), which are characterized by different epidemiological and clinical properties. Both RS-PCR and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed on strains isolated from bovine bulk tank milk (BTM) collected from dairy herds located in the Lombardy region (northern Italy), to outline the distribution of Staph. aureus genotypes in this geographical area. Out of 844 examined samples, 398 were positive for Staph. aureus, with a variable number of cfu/mL. Up to 8 colonies from each sample were genotyped. A total of 1,101 Staph. aureus strains were analyzed with RS-PCR, and only a selection of them (n = 86), in relation to their frequency and geographical origin, underwent MLST. This study revealed 8 major genotypic clusters (CLB, CLC, CLR, CLS, CLI, CLF, CLAO, and CLZ), of which Staph. aureus CLB (29.3%) was the most common. Samples of BTM positive for CLB had a Staph. aureus cfu/mL count significantly higher than the non-CLB positive ones. Our MLST analysis showed genotypes already known as bovine-associated in literature, such as clonal complexes CC8, CC97, and CC151. The same selection of 86 strains was also analyzed for the presence of the adlb gene, which was recently proposed as a possible marker of contagiousness. Most Staph. aureus belonging to CLB or CC8 carried the adlb gene (85%), whereas this gene was detected in only 9% of non-CLB strains (CLAA, CLBI, CLBJ, CLS). In conclusion, the present study confirms that Staph. aureus CLB, which is recognized as a contagious genotype, is a particularly relevant agent of intramammary infection in dairy cows in Lombardy, and indirectly supports the idea that adlb can be a possible marker of contagiousness of isolates.",

The calculation of the proposed integration index makes provisions for a generalized assessment of the potential of different industries in the regions. It can identify the most promising directions for development of economic sectors at the state level. This method can be applied to different industries in the territorial context of other countries.

With the aim of facilitating captive breeding in brown-marbled grouper, effects on gamete post-activation, post-stripping egg storage and sperm to egg ratio on fertilization success were investigated. Results indicated eggs were fertile for 4 min after placement in seawater, thereafter, there was a reduction in fertilization. Initial curvilinear velocity (VCL) and total motility of fresh sperm was 129.3 ± 3.7 μm/s and 92.9 ± 2.4%, both of which decreased as time elapsed post-activation, however, there was no significant difference in fertilization until 6 min post-activation of sperm. Compared with fertilization and hatching rates in eggs used immediately after collection (95.0 ± 2.8% and 90.1 ± 4.2%), in vitro storage of eggs had no detectable effect on fertilized egg and hatching rates until 60 min post-stripping (92.0 ± 2.8% and 89.9 ± 2.7%), indicating that immediate use of brown-marbled grouper eggs for fertilization is not necessary in aquaculture hatcheries. With regard to optimizing the sperm to egg ratio, there was acceptable fertilization with ratios ranging from 103 to 107, whereas there was a marked decrease in fertilization rate when there were lesser sperm concentrations.

        "abstract": "Studies have evaluated the effects of zinc (Zn) supplementation as an important dietary factor that regulates intestinal amino acid metabolism, protecting and preventing diarrhea. Threonine (Thr) also plays an important role in intestinal mucosa, playing a key role in the innate immune defence of mucosa. Thus, the present study evaluated the combined effects of Thr and chelated Zn on egg production and egg quality of brown laying hens from 20 to 48 weeks and on nutrient balance at week 49. The hypothesis was that a lower level of Zn chelated in the diet could be favorable for the use of Thr by laying hens. Thus, two experimental designs were made. Experiment number 1: A completed randomized design with six replicate cages per treatment was done. The structure of the treatment was a 4 × 5 factorial arrangement with five levels of total Thr (6.14, 6.98, 8.75, 10.06 and 10.55 g/kg) and four analyzed levels of Zn (31, 73, 104 and 121 mg / kg). A total of 120 cages was used. Each cage had eight hens. In this experiment the experimental unit was the cage with 8 hens. The response variables analyzed were related to egg production and quality. Experiment number 2: It was identical to experiment 1, but only four repetitions were used per treatment and each cage had 4 hens. The experimental unit was the cage with 4 hens. The response variables analyzed were related to the nutrient balance, and apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen (AMEN). An interaction effect between Zn and Thr levels was observed on egg production, egg weight, nitrogen balance and AMEN. Quadratic equations indicated that increasing dietary levels of Zn reduced Thr estimates for hens. General performance results suggest a total Thr concentration of 8.38 ± 0.43 g/kg or 880 ± 43 mg/day, however, a level of chelated Zn above 40 mg/kg negatively affected egg quality. Corn and soybean meal diet naturally provided the zinc requirement egg production. Higher Zn levels can reduce nutrient and energy intake and efficiency, limiting its retention by laying hens and affecting productive performance. As for interaction, the apparent lower estimate of Thr to ensure egg production and egg weight with increased Zn concentration in the diet may imply a gradual increase in Zn excretion. Thus, costs related to food and the environment must also be considered.",

        "abstract": "The aim was to study the effect of storage (high moisture airtight (HMA) storage vs. dry storage) and a combination of phytase, xylanase, β-glucanase, and protease on nutrient solubility and digestibility of barley. Experiment 1 studied the effect of HMA stored barley at 29%, 35%, and 40% moisture and enzyme combination to define the optimum moisture level for the maximum nutrient solubility of barley. The ‘35% moisture’ was chosen for HMA storage of barley because this treatment (without or with enzymes) enhanced phytate degradation (31–73%) and the solubility of P (125–177%), nitrogen (N) (95–125%) and protein (56–68%) compared to dry storage (P < 0.05) and at the same time seemed to prevent a loss of energy and N (ammonia) by microbial fermentation. In Exp. 2, 6 female growing pigs (43 ± 2 kg) were used per diet (8 diets, 48 pigs) in a 12-d nutrient digestibility study to assess the effect of HMA stored barley at 35% moisture and enzyme combination on coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of P in barley fed alone or together with soybean meal (SBM). Also, HMA storage of barley at ‘35% moisture’ without and with enzyme combination enhanced phytate degradation (43–58%) and P solubility (2.5–3.3 fold) (P < 0.05). Thus, HMA stored barley (solely endogenous enzymes) enhanced CTTAD of P to almost the same extent as dry stored barley with enzyme combination (endogenous enzymes plus added enzymes) in the barley diet (45–49%) and the barley-SBM diet (15–25%) (P < 0.05). Adding the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley achieved the greatest increase of CTTAD of P in the barley diet (70%) and the barley-SBM diet (36%) (P < 0.05). The inclusion of the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley tended to enhance the calculated CTTAD of P of SBM (29%) compared with no enzyme combination (P = 0.06) due to the lower endogenous enzymes activity in HMA stored barley. It is necessary to add the enzyme combination to enhance P digestibility of SBM when fed together with HMA stored barley. Overall, HMA storage with enzyme combination is a potential method to enhance P digestibility of barley in pigs to reduce the dietary need for inorganic P addition and P excretion to the environment.",

        "abstract": "The addition of phytase enzyme to broiler feed as a means of improving phosphorus (P) availability and reducing P excretion is widespread practice. New phytases with enhanced functionality continue to be developed. We tested the effects of a next generation biosynthetic bacterial 6-phytase on growth performance, tibia ash and P digestibility in broilers. Treatments included a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) diet, a negative control (NC) diet formulated with reductions in Ca and available P (avP) of 2.0 g/kg and 1.9 g/kg (starter phase) and 2.0 g/kg and 1.8 g/kg (finisher phase), respectively, and three further diets comprising the NC supplemented with three levels of phytase (250, 500 or 1000 FTU/kg). Diets were fed in mash form to day-old Cobb 500 broilers housed in pens (9 pens for NC, 10 pens for all other treatments; 24 birds/pen), in two phases (starter, days 1–21; finisher, days 22–42). Tibias were collected from 4 birds on day 21 and from 6 birds on day 42 for determination of defatted tibia ash. Ileal digesta was collected on day 21 for determination of apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients. Compared to PC, the NC exhibited reduced tibia ash at day 21 and 42, resulting in reduced average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during starter, finisher, and overall phases, and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) during finisher phase and overall (P < 0.05). Phytase at any dose-level during both phases improved tibia ash vs. NC (P < 0.05) and maintained feed intake and growth parameters equivalent to the PC. At a dose-level of 500 FTU/kg or above, phytase supplementation increased AID of P vs. NC (P < 0.05) and at 1000 FTU/kg, phytase improved the AID of P compared with PC (P < 0.05). For all measures, response values were numerically highest with 1000 FTU/kg and increased linearly or quadratically with increasing phytase dose (P < 0.05). Phytase at 1000 FTU/kg produced birds with an average day 42 body weight of 2.74 kg and overall FCR of 1.626, comparable to PC. On a grams per kilogram diet basis, phytase at 1000 FTU/kg improved ileal digestible P by 1.76 g/kg above NC (at day 21). This is equivalent to 2.07 g P from monocalcium phosphate (MCP-P), based on digestible P improvement. The results suggest the novel biosynthetic phytase has high functionality in the tested dietary setting.",

        "abstract": "Carinata meal, a co-product from carinata seed oil extraction plants, is available for livestock feeding. Also, cold-pressed canola expellers (Cold-pressed CME), a co-product from canola seed oil extraction plants, is available for livestock feeding. The nutritive value of carinata meal for pigs has not been reported. Also, there is limited information on the nutritive value of cold-pressed CME for pigs. The objective of this study was to determine standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) and net energy value of carinata meal and Cold-pressed CME for growing pigs. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (initial body weight = 32.7 ± 1.46 kg) were fed 3 diets a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design in combination with a 3 × 2 Youden square design, to give 8 replicates/diet. The diets were cornstarch-based, containing Cold-pressed CME or carinata meal as sole protein source, and N-free. Digestibility of AA in feedstuffs was determined by the direct method. Energy digestibility in Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal was determined by difference from the N-free diet. On dry matter basis (DM), Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal contained 396 and 502 g/kg crude protein, 207 and 268 g/kg neutral detergent fiber, 160 and 8.8 g/kg ether extract, 23.2 and 18.2 g/kg lysine, 7.4 and 9.6 g/kg methionine, 16.3 and 18.9 g/kg threonine, and 5.0 and 6.4 g/kg tryptophan, respectively. The Cold-pressed CME compared with carinata meal, had greater (P < 0.05) SID of lysine (0.744 vs. 0.601). Conversely, Cold-pressed CME compared with carinata meal, had lower (P < 0.05) SID of methionine (0.821 vs. 0.878) and tryptophan (0.818 vs. 0.898), and tended to be lower (P = 0.078) in SID of threonine. The Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal did not differ in coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility of gross energy (0.433 vs. 0.376). The Cold-pressed CME had lower (P < 0.05) coefficient of apparent total tract digestibility of GE than carinata meal (0.573 vs. 0.671). The Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal did not differ in digestible energy (12.99 vs. 12.83 MJ/kg). However, Cold-pressed CME had greater (P < 0.05) net energy value than carinata meal (8.20 vs. 6.74 MJ/kg DM). In conclusion, carinata meal has lower energy value than Cold-pressed CME, however, the former had greater SID of most AA than the latter. Both Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal can serve as alternative oilseed co-product feedstuffs for pigs.",

Test diets contained 4 g/ kg of TiO2 as a digestibility marker and protease (CIBENZA® DP100 at 300 U/g diet, Novus International). A randomized complete block design was analyzed using ANOVA with LSD multiple pair-wise comparison used to compare treatment means. For Exp 2 and 3, a common starter diet was fed to broiler chickens until d 16 of life and then switched to test diets. Exp 1 was a 2×6 factorial arrangement of 2 protease levels (0 and 300 U/g) and 6 dietary TI levels (0.72, 1.16, 1.61, 2.06, 2.50, and 2.95 mg/g) with 6 replicates/treatment; 8 chicks/pen. In Exp 2 (12 replicates/treatment; 8 chicks/pen), apparent ileal AA digestibility (AIAAD) was evaluated in diets containing 250 g/kg full fat extruded soybeans (FFES)+SBM (negative control; 5.8 mg/g TI) with or without protease or SBM (positive control; 3.1 mg/g TI). Test diets were fed from d 16–21 of age, AIAAD and relative pancreas weight was measured on d 21. In Exp. 3, broilers were allocated to a 2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments with 9 replicates/treatment and 8 chicks/ pen. The dietary factors were SBM inclusion (420 or 960 g/kg; SBM TI = 3.85 mg/g), or protease inclusion (0 or 300 U/g). Test diets were fed from d 22–30, ileal digesta was collected on d 30. With increasing TI, pancreas weight increased (P < 0.05; Exp 1 and 2), and AIAAD decreased (P < 0.05; Exp 1–3). Protease decreased pancreas weight (P < 0.05) and improved AIAAD in Exp 2 (P < 0.05; average AIAAD increase was 3 %). In Exp 3, protease increased (P < 0.05) AIAAD only in diets containing high TI (average AIAAD improvement was 3.6 %). In conclusion, protease could be effective in mitigating high TI in SBM by increasing AIAAD digestibility.",

        "abstract": "The long-term unsustainability of fish oil as a lipid source in aquaculture feeds has led to its progressive replacement with vegetable oils. Several studies have shown that this replacement results in a different fatty acid profile that is likely to compromise the healthy properties and quality of fish by reducing their n-3 HUFA content. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of partial replacement of fish oil with vegetable oils on the quality of the final product. Eighty-four gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were fed one of two different commercial diets for 19 weeks in triplicate (14 fish per tank). These diets contained either 100 % fish oil (FO diet) or a 75 % vegetable oil blend (VO diet) (50/50 mixture of soybean and rapeseed oil). After slaughter, physical-chemical analyses (Fatty Acids (FAs); flesh color; Water-Holding Capacity (WHC); pH; and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA)) and a sensory analysis were performed. Fish fed either diet displayed similar growth and feed conversion rates (SGR and FCR). The fish fed the VO diet showed an increase in muscular n-6 fatty acids, which resulted in a lower n-3/n-6 ratio. A lower presence of EPA and DHA fatty acids was also observed, although the total quantity of n-3 fatty acids was similar in both groups. With regard to fat quality, the Atherogenic Index (AI) was lower in the VO-diet group, while both groups presented a similar Thrombogenic Index (TI). The diet had some effect on quality parameters, but the changes were not very intense. The differences observed in the a* and b* chromatic parameters were not significant, but a greater and significant color saturation in the vegetable oil group was observed. No significant differences in pH and WHC were observed. Fish fed the vegetal oil diet also scored higher for hardness, springiness, gumminess and chewiness. In the sensory analysis no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The differences observed for both the fatty acid profile and the quality parameters do not appear to have any important implications in terms of either health or the sensory properties of gilthead seabream fed a vegetable oil diet.",

Our objective was to assess the impact of different dietary Thr inclusion levels (70, 85, 100, 115, or 130% of the estimated ideal 0.65 Thr:Lys ratio) on growth performance, plasma biochemical parameters, and splanchnic and muscle AA composition in pigs raised in a conventional group phase feeding (GPF) system and in an individual precision feeding (IPF) system. A total of 110 finishing pigs (110 ± 7.02 kg initial body weight; 11 pigs per treatment) were housed in the same room for 21 d. Pigs were randomly assigned to a 2 × 5 factorial arrangement and fed using automatic feeders. Individual pigs were considered the experimental units. Five pigs per treatment were slaughtered at the end of the trial. The gain:feed ratio was not affected by feeding system, but there was a quadratic effect of Thr inclusion rate (P < 0.05). Lysine intake was 16% greater and Thr intake was 15% greater for the GPF pigs than for the IPF pigs (P < 0.05). Protein deposition (g/d) was not affected by any treatment. Protein deposition in daily gain was affected by the interaction between Thr inclusion rate and feeding system, with a quadratic (P < 0.05) effect for the GPF pigs and a cubic (P < 0.10) effect for the IPF pigs. The pigs in IPF consumed 14% less (P < 0.05) crude protein and excreted 17% less (P < 0.05) N than the GPF pigs did. The pigs in IPF retained 9% more (P < 0.05) N than the GPF pigs. Plasma urea values were 9% higher (P < 0.05) in GPF than those in IPF. The gamma-glutamyl transferase enzyme decreased (P < 0.05) in a quadratic manner within IPF but increased (P < 0.05) in a quadratic manner within GPF. In the IPF systems, the average concentration of albumin and C-reactive protein tended (P < 0.10) to be 2 and 22% lower, respectively, than in GPF. Changes in amino acid concentrations occurred mainly in the liver of the IPF pigs. The pigs in IPF had higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of collagen in the longissimus dorsi than the pigs in GPF. Lastly, IPF allowed standardized ileal digestible Lys and Thr intakes to decrease by 16 and 15%, respectively, without differences in average daily gain and gain:feed ratio in comparison with GPF.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of supplemental Clostridium butyricum on production performance and intestinal absorption function of laying hens in the late phase of production. A total of 384 59-week-old Hy-Line Brown layers were randomly divided into 4 groups that consisted of 8 replicates with 12 birds each. Birds were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.3, 0.9 or 2.7 g/kg C. butyricum (the actual bacterial count was 9.3 × 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/g). The experiment lasted for 8 weeks after a 1-week adaptation period. Results showed that increasing C. butyricum addition resulted in a quadratic reduction (P < 0.05) of feed conversion ratio of layers from weeks 5 to 8 and from weeks 1 to 8, concurrent with quadratic elevations (P < 0.05) in yolk color, ileal villus height, ileal lipase and alkaline phosphatase activities of layers at the end of week 8. These responses were maximized at medium dose (0.9 g/kg) of C. butyricum addition. Furthermore, there were quadratic increases (P < 0.05) in ileal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and sodium-potassium ATPase activity, along with the relative mRNA expression of ileal L-type amino acid transporter-1 and fatty acid-binding protein-1 of layers at the end of week 8 due to the increase of C. butyricum addition, with 0.9 g/kg being the most effective. In conclusion, dietary C. butyricum supplementation could improve feed efficiency and yolk color of laying hens in the late phase of production probably through the promotion of intestinal absorption function. The optimal dose of C. butyricum in layer diet in the present study was 0.9 g/kg (8.37 × 108 CFU/kg).",

        "abstract": "Our objective with this review is to encourage more research about the use of soy protein in young calf diets by learning from the mistakes of the past and acknowledging the promising results found when modern techniques are applied to treat soybeans. Total or partial substitution of milk proteins with soy proteins can represent a substantial increase in the economic efficiency of calf diets as long as it does not affect calf performance. Unfortunately, the results found in the literature indicate that the inclusion of soy protein in diets of young calves usually diminishes growth and health outcomes. The interaction of the antinutritional factors and antigenic proteins in soybeans with the gastrointestinal tract triggers a physiological response with negative consequences for the digestive tract and immune system of the calf. In this article, we highlight the importance of a correct processing method of soybeans by reviewing some of the published research that has evaluated different soy-based ingredients in diets for young calves. Conventional methods such as heating, ethanol extraction, and protein isolation can produce favorable results provided that the final product contains minimum or null amounts of antigenic and antinutritional factors. More recently, further processing methods such as microbial treatment of soybean meal reduces those antinutritional and antigenic factors, and can also increase the quality of soy protein by reducing the peptide size and by triggering the release of bioactive compounds. Experiments in which soy protein modified by this method was fed have increased in the scientific literature during the last decade due to the favorable results obtained in calves as well as in monogastric animals.",

Methods: A total of 8269 participants who did not have type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Dietary intake was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: Over 50,063 person-years of follow-up, 531 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Significant doseeresponse inverse associations were observed between dietary soy protein and isoflavones (quartiles) and type 2 diabetes in women (incidence rate ratio, IRR ¼ 0.63, 95% CI ¼ 0.45e0.87, P for trend ¼ 0.0078 for soy protein; IRR ¼ 0.62, 95% CI ¼ 0.45e0.86, P for trend ¼ 0.0031 for total isoflavones for the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile).

No significant association of high consumption with lung cancer, liver cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, or colorectal and anal cancer was found.\n\nConclusions: In our sample of Chinese with much lower milk consumption than those in the West, compared with no consumption, moderate milk consumption showed a lower risk of CVD mortality, but high milk consumption showed a higher risk of total cancer mortality. Further studies are warranted to verify the differential effects of milk on CVD and cancer.\n\nKeywords: Cancer; Cardiovascular disease; Ischemic heart disease; Milk consumption; Mortality; Stroke.",

        "abstract": "Field pea is an alternative starch and protein source for swine; however, feeding raw field pea to weaned pigs may reduce feed efficiency (G:F). Growth performance of weaned pigs fed field pea processed using treatments with heat and friction is unknown. To explore the effects of feed processing, field pea was ground (4.0-mm sieve), then either cold-pelleted (70–75 °C), steampelleted (80–85 °C) or extruded (115 °C) and then re-ground (3.2-mm sieve). Diets included 400 g per kg raw, cold-pelleted, steam-pelleted or extruded field pea replacing 300 g soybean meal (SBM) and 100 g wheat grain and were formulated to provide 10.0 MJ net energy (NE)/kg and 12.1 g standardised ileal digestible lysine/kg. In total, 236 pigs (weaned at 20 days of age) were housed in 60 pens in 4 rooms and fed 1 of 5 diets starting 2 weeks post-weaning [initial body weight (BW): 10 kg] for 3 weeks. The CATTD of gross energy and crude protein, digestible energy and predicted NE value were lower (P < 0.001) in field pea diets than in SBM diets and were not affected by processing of field pea. Overall (day 1–21), average daily feed intake of pigs fed raw or processed field pea diets (853–882 g/day) was greater (P = 0.001) than pigs fed SBM diet (813 g/day). Average daily gain did not differ between SBM diet and field pea diets, nor did it differ among field pea treatments. Thus, G:F was lower (P < 0.001) for pigs fed field pea diets (0.60–0.63) than for pigs fed SBM diet (0.68), but did not differ among field pea treatments. Final BW of pigs fed raw, cold-pelleted, steam-pelleted, extruded field pea and SBM diets were 21.0, 21.1, 21.3, 21.4 and 21.7 kg respectively. Final BW was not affected (P > 0.05) by feeding or processing of field pea. To conclude, weaned pigs fed 400 g field pea/kg diet in substitution of SBM could maintain growth performance. Greater ADFI for field pea diets than SBM diet indicated that pigs compensated for the reduced energy value of field pea diets. Raw field pea can be included in late nursery diets without thermal treatment to replace 300 g SBM and 100 g wheat grain/kg diet",

        "abstract": "A study was conducted to compare maize, wheat and sorghum as the main feed grain in standard phytase and xylanase supplemented diets for broiler chickens. Six diets with different grain varieties (two wheat, two sorghum and two maize) were formulated in accordance with Ross 308 recommendations for starter, grower and finisher diets and were offered from 1 to 10, 11–26 and 27–35 days post-hatch, respectively. The six treatments were offered to 672 male Ross 308 chicks, with eight replicate cages per treatment and 14 birds per cage from 1 to 10 days post-hatch and 6 birds per cage from 11 to 35 days post-hatch. Over the 1–35 day experimental period, birds offered diets based on maize B generated the most efficient feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1.380), whereas birds offered red sorghum-based diets generated the poorest FCR (1.478). Likewise, in the finisher phase, birds offered both maize and wheat generated significantly greater apparent metabolisable energy (AME, MJ/kg DM), AME to gross energy ratio (AME:GE, MJ/MJ) and nitrogen corrected AME (AMEn, MJ/kg DM) than birds offered sorghum-based diets. Birds offered diets containing wheat A generated the greatest starch digestibility coefficient in the jejunum and ileum in both starter and finisher diets and red sorghum outperformed white sorghum in terms of AME and starch digestibility. In the ileum, broiler chickens offered finisher diets based on wheat B had the highest protein digestibility. In conclusion, birds offered maize-based diets achieved the best growth performance and energy utilisation followed by birds offered wheat- and sorghum-based diets.",

A total of 900 male broilers were allocated into 60 pens. In phase 1, dietary treatments were high (H, 9.6 g/kg Ca and 4.8 g/kg NPP), moderate (M, 7.6 g/kg Ca and 3.8 g/kg NPP), low (L, 5.6 g/kg Ca and 2.8 g/kg NPP) and very low (VL, 3.6 g/kg Ca and 1.8 g/kg) level of Ca and NPP. H and M diets showed higher average daily feed intake (ADFI) and serum Ca than those of L and VL diets. There was a linear decrease in tibia Ca and serum P and a linear increase in relative expression of SLC20A1 and CALB1 and retention of Ca and P when concentration of Ca and NPP was reduced. H diet resulted in the highest tarsometatarsus strength and feed conversion ratio (FCR). M and L diets showed higher average daily gain (ADG) than those of H and VL diets. VL diet demonstrated the lowest tibia ash. On day 25, treatments H, M, L and VL received, respectively, 4, 3, 2 and 1 types of finisher diets (H, M, L and VL) during phase 2, resulting in a total of 10 treatments; HH, HM, HL, HVL, MM, ML, MVL, LL, LVL and VLVL. HH vs. HM vs. HL vs. HVL showed a linear decrease of ADFI, ADG, serum P, tibia ash, tarsometatarsus strength and a linear increase of FCR. HH vs. MM vs. LL vs. VLVL demonstrated a linear increase of relative expression of CALB1 and SLC20A1 and a linear decrease of serum P, and in terms of growth performance, MM showed the best results generally. MM vs. ML vs. MVL showed a linear decrease of ADFI and ADG and a linear increase of FCR. HM vs. ML vs. LVL demonstrated a linear decrease of ADG, serum Ca and P and relative expression of CALB1 and a linear increase of FCR (during phase 2). In conclusion, reducing Ca and NPP level over finisher phase, similarly for all combinations of treatments, resulted in poorer performance either in finisher phase or the whole period. Generally, 7.6 g/kg Ca and 3.8 g/kg NPP over the whole period maximized broiler’s performance without negative effects on bone ash and strength.",

        "abstract": "Irrational usage of antibiotic feed additives in livestock industry, especially as growth promoters, has become a global challenge due to the unintended zoonotic impact through resistance transfer. Herbal plant extracts or their secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties may possess similar effects of various antibiotic feed additives in impeding the pathogenic microbial growth and enhancing the health, growth, and production performance. Majority of the calf-plant extract associated research works were primarily geared towards phenolic compounds and essential oils, with a few related to terpenes, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, organic acids, complex carbohydrates, and non-protein amino acids. The plant secondary metabolites possess diverse antimicrobial mechanisms, including cell membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, substrate deprivation, and prevention of bacterial colonization, to name a few. Further, the unification of different levels and types of plant metabolites before supplementing to calves renders synergistic effects, which aids in several beneficial responses such as increased bioavailability, improved efficiency, and reduced undesirable effects and effective dosage. Nevertheless, the employment of herbal extracts or plant metabolites as antimicrobial feed additives to calves retain many challenges regarding the dosages, levels, adaptation lengths, herbal or herb-drug interactions, analytical methods, and public health safety. The present review focuses on assembling existing data on the plant-based antimicrobial components, individual secondary plant metabolites or plant extracts, which are already in use or having the efficacy in benefitting calves on supplementation",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA) fed alone or in association with a Cr methionine complex (CrMet) on the performance and meat quality of Nellore cattle finished in a feedlot. Three hundred thirty-six Nellore bulls were blocked by body weight (BW; 342 ± 24.5 kg) and assigned to one of the following three dietary treatments: a control diet containing 54 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source of minerals (CON); a diet providing 21.6 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source with 32.4 mg/kg of a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA); and a diet providing 21.6 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source with 32.4 mg/kg of a Zn amino acid complex combined with 0.36 mg/kg of a CrMet complex (ZnCr). The total number of days on the diets was 130 days, with an initial 35-d period for dietary acclimation to the finishing diet. Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with the pen as the experimental unit (36 pens). Blood parameters and meat quality were analyzed as repeated measures (from 72 animals; 2 animals/pen). The final BW, dry matter intake (DMI), and average daily gain (ADG) was similar among the treatments (P ≥ 0.261). The overall mean DMI, final BW, and ADG were 9.15 kg/d, 535 kg, and 1.49 kg/d, respectively. Feeding ZnCr improved efficiency (P = 0.011) compared with the ZnAA and CON bulls. Leucocytes, aminotransferase, β-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, glucose, and cortisol were affected (P ≤ 0.038) by time but not by dietary treatment. Flight speed and serum cortisol level were unaffected (P ≥ 0.518) by dietary treatment. No significant treatment effects (P ≥ 0.169) were detected for hot carcass weight, fat, pH, temperature, liver, kidney, or KPH. Treatment tended to alter the area of the Longissimus muscle (P = 0.081). The Longissimus muscle area was greater for bulls fed ZnCr than for bulls fed ZnAA or CON (80.6 vs. 77.5 cm2). There was a tendency (P = 0.073) for decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force in animals fed ZnCr. Tenderness was improved by 12.3 % compared with CON. Individual fatty acids (P ≥ 0.171) and total fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated; P ≥ 0.392) did not differ among the treatments. These data suggest that finishing Nellore bulls fed ZnCr in a feedlot setting exhibited greater efficiency and tended to exhibit improved meat tenderness compared with bulls fed ZnAA.",

        "abstract": "Mao-tofu is traditionally coagulated by natural fermented tofu sour water (NFTSW), which contains large numbers of microorganisms from the environment. Nonetheless, the microorganisms accountable for coagulation require further analysis and characterization. Our aim was to evaluate the bacteria in NFTSW that carry out the traditional fermentation process of Mao-tofu by using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results show that Lactobacillus ultunensis, Enterococcus bulliens, Lactobacillus graminis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus mucosae are the primary bacteria involved in brewing. Furthermore, 6 types of lactic acid bacteria were sequestered from NFTSW by methodology dependent on culture and their acid-producing abilities were analyzed. The results indicated that strain L1, which was identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, produced the highest lactic acid content of 2.85 g/100 mL. Simulated coagulation further confirmed that strain L1 was preferable for Mao-tofu coagulation through the evaluation of textural properties, volatile flavour compounds, and sensory characteristics. The results suggested that Lactobacillus delbrueckii might be the core functional microorganism significantly contributing to flavor compound synthesis during the traditional production of Chinese Huizhou Mao-tofu. The research method we used in this investigation may encourage detection of the main microorganisms with different roles involved in other food fermentation processes.",

        "abstract": "The fates of clomazone, fomesafen, and quizalofop-p-ethyl and its metabolite quizalofop (acid) in soybean samples during tofu processing were systematically assessed. Residues were determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) after each processing step, including washing, soaking, grinding and filtering, cooking, coagulating, and squeezing. The pesticide distribution at each step of the process was studied, and pesticide processing factors were calculated. Differences in the pesticide residue levels were found at each processing step. Changes in pesticide residues in the tofu products was closely related to their physicochemical properties such as octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), water solubility, and vapor pressure. The results showed that soaking prominently decreased fomesafen residues by 72.0%, as indicated by its high water-solubility and low log Kow. Grinding and filtering reduced pesticide residues by 88.8%–94.8%, mainly due to dilution or okara separation. The processing factors were generally <1 for each step and for the entire process, except those for cooking, coagulating, and squeezing. These results demonstrated that the overall process could significantly reduce clomazone, fomesafen, quizalofop-p-ethyl, quizalofop (acid) residues during tofu processing.",

Furthermore, sample genomic DNAs were used in\nconventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify approximately 900-bp fragments from 18S ribosomal\nDNA. Of 180 samples, 170 samples (94.4%) were microscopically and 161 samples (89.44%) were molecularly\npositive for Sarcocystis spp. Eucoccidial DNA fragments were detected in 161 samples (89.4%), including 78\n(86.6%) beef and 83 (92.2%) beef burger samples.

Materials and methods: Notches were surgically prepared in the root surface at the bone crest level of the first premolars of mongrel dogs. After 37 days, extrusion of the first lower and upper premolars was randomly performed by 3 different methods: conventional orthodontic extrusion (OE); open flap debridement performed immediately before orthodontic extrusion (OF); and orthodontic extrusion associated with weekly fiberotomy and scaling (FS). For all groups, extrusion was performed for 21 days followed by one-month retention and sacrifice. Periodontal parameters, descriptive histology, and histomorphometric analyses were performed at the end of the experimental period. Results: The median extrusion was 2.25 in the fiberotomy group, 2.0 mm in the open flap group and 1.0 mm in the orthodontic extrusion group with no significant differences between groups. The highest distance between reference notch and bone crest was observed in the fiberotomy group (p < 0.05). Histologically, radicular resorption repaired with cellular cementum was detected in all groups. Conclusions: Tooth extrusion was successfully achieved with all of the different methods of orthodontic tooth extrusion with no statistical significance between techniques.

If the co-formulants are properly selected, WGs typically have desirable physical and chemical stability. In addition, storage and transport of dry formulations are inherently easier than liquid formulation types. WG formulations of agricultural products offer the added advantage of low dust and safer handling compared to wettable powders (WP).\n\nWG formulations can be prepared via several types of granulation processes, with paste extrusion being the most common in crop protection products. Granules created by paste extrusion generally offer improved resistance to attrition, and higher and more consistent bulk density compared to WP formulations. Rapid and complete dispersion in a variety of water conditions is a key performance parameters used to evaluate WG formulations.\n\nAmong common paste extrusion methods, basket and dome extrusion are the two widely used techniques. Basket extrusion is thought to be less process sensitive. Historically, products originally designed to be dome extruded can often be basket extruded, but not vice versa. In this work, milled powder premixes of varying water solubility are paste extruded using these two technologies. The paste extrudates are dried using a lab scale vibratory fluidized bed.

Unfortunately, the as-cast Zn-based alloys do not fulfil the requirements for mechanical properties for such applications. Extrusion is a thermomechanical process which is very powerful for breaking the cast microstructure and enhancing mechanical characteristics of metallic materials. In this study, we focused on the influence of extrusion parameters, such as temperature and extrusion ratio, on microstructural and mechanical characteristics of a ZnMg0.8Ca0.2 (wt.%) alloy. The extrusion led to a significant grain refinement and the formation of a crystallographic texture. Extrusion temperature played a more significant role in the mean grain size compared to the extrusion ratio (ER). At lower extrusion temperatures, the texture was less intensive and the subsequent mechanical anisotropy was weaker. Constants for the prediction of the grain size based on the ZenerHollomon parameter were obtained. Prediction of mechanical properties using the Hall-Petch relationship appeared to be difficult because of the dependence of the texture on the extrusion temperature. Extrusion at the temperatures of 200 �C (ER ¼ 25:1) and 150 �C (ER ¼ 11:1) led to mechanical performance fulfilling the requirements for implantology.",
