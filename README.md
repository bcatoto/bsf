# Black Sheep Foods

### Set Up
1. Make sure you have `python3.7` and the `pip` module installed. We recommend using `pipenv` to handle the virtual environment.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.
3. Run `pipenv install` to install all the required packages. Note: If there is a conflict because the virtual environment is running another version of Python other than 3.7, run `pipenv --python 3.7`. If you are using pipenv and any of the packages fail to install, install the packages separately with `pipenv install package_name`.

Now you can run `python scraper.py` to test the scraper for Springer Nature.
