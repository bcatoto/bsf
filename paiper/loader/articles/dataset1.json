      "title": "Plant-Based Meat Substitutes in the Flexitarian Age: An Audit of Products on Supermarket Shelves",
      "abstract": "Demand for plant-based meat substitutes is growing globally for nutritional and environmental reasons, with Australia the third-fastest growing vegan market worldwide. This study aimed to profile and compare plant-based meat substitutes (mimicking meat) with equivalent meat products, and 2015 data. An audit undertaken in May (updated in September 2019) from four metropolitan Sydney supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, IGA), collected nutrition information and Health Star Rating (HSR) from 137 products (50 burgers, 10 mince, 29 sausages, 24 chicken, 9 seafood, 15 other). Mean (± standard deviation (SD)) and median (range) was calculated for nutrients and HSR. Plant-based options were generally lower in kilojoules, total and saturated fat, higher in carbohydrate, sugars, and dietary fibre compared with meat. Only 4% of products were low in sodium (58–1200 mg/100 g). Less than a quarter of products (24%) were fortified with vitamin B12, 20% with iron, and 18% with zinc. HSR featured on 46% (3.6–4.4 stars). On-pack claims were vegetarian/vegan/plant-based (80%), protein (63%), non-genetically modified/organic (34%), gluten free (28%). Product numbers increased five-fold (↑429%) in four years. The plant protein trend has prompted innovation in meat substitutes, however wide nutrient ranges and higher sodium levels highlights the importance of nutrition guidelines in their development to ensure equivalence with animal-based proteins.",

      "title": "Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets",
      "abstract": "Soy is a basic food ingredient of traditional Asian cuisine used for thousands of years. In Western countries, soybeans have been introduced about a hundred years ago and recently they are mainly used for surrogate foods production. Soy and soy foods are common nutritional solutions for vegetarians, due to their high protein content and versatility in the production of meat analogues and milk substitutes. However, there are some doubts about the potential effects on health, such as the effectiveness on cardiovascular risk reduction or, conversely, on the possible disruption of thyroid function and sexual hormones. The soy components that have stimulated the most research interest are isoflavones, which are polyphenols with estrogenic properties highly contained in soybeans. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of soy and soy foods, focusing on their nutrient content, including phytoestrogens and other bioactive substances that are noteworthy for vegetarians, the largest soy consumers in the Western countries. The safety of use will also be discussed, given the growing trend in adoption of vegetarian styles and the new soy-based foods availability.",

      "title": "Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets",
      "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Approximately 2.5% of adults in the United States and 4% of adults in Canada follow vegetarian diets. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat, fish, or fowl. Interest in vegetarianism appears to be increasing, with many restaurants and college foodservices offering vegetarian meals routinely. Substantial growth in sales of foods attractive to vegetarians has occurred, and these foods appear in many supermarkets. This position paper reviews the current scientific data related to key nutrients for vegetarians, including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, n-3 fatty acids, and iodine. A vegetarian, including vegan, diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, use of fortified foods or supplements can be helpful in meeting recommendations for individual nutrients. Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower blood pressure; and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. Although a number of federally funded and institutional feeding programs can accommodate vegetarians, few have foods suitable for vegans at this time. Because of the variability of dietary practices among vegetarians, individual assessment of dietary intakes of vegetarians is required. Dietetics professionals have a responsibility to support and encourage those who express an interest in consuming a vegetarian diet. They can play key roles in educating vegetarian clients about food sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and any dietary modifications that may be necessary to meet individual needs. Menu planning for vegetarians can be simplified by use of a food guide that specifies food groups and serving sizes.",

      "title": "Protein/energy ratios of current diets in developed and developing countries compared with a safe protein/energy ratio: implications for recommended protein and amino acid intakes",
      "abstract": "Revised estimates of protein and amino acid requirements are under discussion by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organizaion (WHO), and have been proposed in a recent report on Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) from the USA. The nature and magnitude of these requirements are not entirely resolved, and no consideration has been given to the potential influence of metabolic adaptation on dietary requirements. We have examined the implications of these new values, and of the conceptual metabolic framework in which they are used, for defining the nutritional adequacy of protein intakes in developed and developing countries. We have expressed proposed values for protein requirements in relation to energy requirements, predicted for physical activity levels of 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0 times basal metabolic rate, in order to generate reference ratios for protein energy/total energy (reference P/E ratio) as a function of age, body weight, gender and physical activity level. Proposed values for amino acid requirements have been used to adjust the available digestible P/E ratio of foods and diets for protein quality. Focusing on the diets of UK omnivores and vegetarians and on diets in India, the risk of protein deficiency is evaluated from a comparison of P/E ratios of metabolic requirements with protein-quality-adjusted P/E ratios of intakes. A qualitative and conservative estimate of risk of deficiency is made by comparing the adjusted P/E ratio of the intake with a reference P/E ratio calculated for age, body weight, gender and physical activity according to FAO/WHO/United Nations University. A semi-quantitative estimate of risk of deficiency has also been made by the cut point approach, calculated as the proportion of the intake distribution below the mean P/E ratio of the requirement. Values for the quality-adjusted P/E ratio of the diet range from 0.126 for the UK omnivore diet to 0.054 for a rice-based diet of adults in West Bengal, which is lysine-limited, falling to 0.050 for 1-year-old children. The reference P/E ratio for men and women increases with age, is higher for females than males, is higher for small compared with large adults at any age and decreases with physical activity. Thus if a particular diet is potentially limiting in protein, protein deficiency is most likely in large, elderly sedentary women followed by the adolescent female and least likely in moderately active young children, the opposite of what has usually been assumed. Within the currently accepted framework, the diets do not meet the protein needs of the entire population of the UK, have a significant risk of deficiency throughout India for all except extremely active small adults, and are grossly inadequate for all population groups, apart from physically active young children in West Bengal, regardless of body weight or level of food intake. The lysine limitation of the cereal-based Indian diets is dependent on the choice of lysine requirement values from the published range. We consider that the value selected is too high, because of uncertainties and inconsistencies in the approaches used. A more appropriate choice from the lower end of the range would remove the lysine limitation of cereal-based diets, and reduce some of the perceived risk of deficiency. However, diets remain limited by the amount of digestible protein for many population groups, especially in West Bengal. In the context of risk management, one option would be to accept the current values and the conceptual metabolic framework within which they have been derived. This would have major implications for the supplies of high-quality protein to the developing countries. An alternative option would be to re-evaluate the currently proposed values for the requirements for protein and amino acids. We conclude that the choice of values for the adult lysine requirement should be re-evaluated and that serious consideration should be given to the extent to which adaptive mechanisms might enable the metabolic requirement for protein to be met from current intakes. This will entail a better understanding of the relationships between dietary protein and health.",

      "abstract": "Background: Creatine monohydrate is a nutritional supplement often consumed by athletes in anaerobic sports. Creatine is naturally found in most meat products; therefore, vegetarians have reduced creatine stores and may benefit from supplementation. Objective: to determine the effects of creatine supplementation on vegetarians. Data sources: PubMed and SPORTDiscus. Eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials (parallel group, cross-over studies) or prospective studies. Participants: Vegetarians. Intervention: Creatine supplementation. Study appraisal and synthesis: A total of 64 records were identified, and eleven full-text articles (covering nine studies) were included in this systematic review. Results: Creatine supplementation in vegetarians increased total creatine, creatine, and phosphocreatine concentrations in vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius muscle, plasma, and red blood cells, often to levels greater than omnivores. Creatine supplementation had no effect on brain levels of phosphocreatine. Creatine supplementation increased lean tissue mass, type II fiber area, insulin-like growth factor-1, muscular strength, muscular endurance, Wingate mean power output, and brain function (memory and intelligence) in vegetarian participants. Studies were mixed on whether creatine supplementation improved exercise performance in vegetarians to a greater extent compared to omnivores. Limitations: Studies that were reviewed had moderate–high risk of bias. Conclusions: Overall, it appears vegetarian athletes are likely to benefit from creatine supplementation.",

      "abstract": "With the growth of social media as a platform to share information, veganism is becoming more visible, and could be becoming more accepted in sports and in the health and fitness industry. However, to date, there appears to be a lack of literature that discusses how to manage vegan diets for athletic purposes. This article attempted to review literature in order to provide recommendations for how to construct a vegan diet for athletes and exercisers. While little data could be found in the sports nutrition literature specifically, it was revealed elsewhere that veganism creates challenges that need to be accounted for when designing a nutritious diet. This included the sufficiency of energy and protein; the adequacy of vitamin B12, iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and vitamin D; and the lack of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in most plant-based sources. However, via the strategic management of food and appropriate supplementation, it is the contention of this article that a nutritive vegan diet can be designed to achieve the dietary needs of most athletes satisfactorily. Further, it was suggested here that creatine and β-alanine supplementation might be of particular use to vegan athletes, owing to vegetarian diets promoting lower muscle creatine and lower muscle carnosine levels in consumers. Empirical research is needed to examine the effects of vegan diets in athletic populations however, especially if this movement grows in popularity, to ensure that the health and performance of athletic vegans is optimised in accordance with developments in sports nutrition knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The quality of vegetarian diets to meet nutritional needs and support peak performance among athletes continues to be questioned. Appropriately planned vegetarian diets can provide sufficient energy and an appropriate range of carbohydrate, fat and protein intakes to support performance and health. The acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges for carbohydrate, fat and protein of 45–65%, 20–35% and 10–35%, respectively, are appropriate for vegetarian and non-vegetarian athletes alike, especially those who perform endurance events. Vegetarian athletes can meet their protein needs from predominantly or exclusively plant-based sources when a variety of these foods are consumed daily and energy intake is adequate. Muscle creatine stores are lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians. Creatine supplementation provides ergogenic responses in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian athletes, with limited data supporting greater ergogenic effects on lean body mass accretion and work performance for vegetarians. The potential adverse effect of a vegetarian diet on iron status is based on the bioavailability of iron from plant foods rather than the amount of total iron present in the diet. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian athletes alike must consume sufficient iron to prevent deficiency, which will adversely affect performance. Other nutrients of concern for vegetarian athletes include zinc, vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and calcium. The main sources of these nutrients are animal products; however, they can be found in many food sources suitable for vegetarians, including fortified soy milk and whole grain cereals. Vegetarians have higher antioxidant status for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E (tocopherol), and ß-carotene than omnivores, which might help reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress. Research is needed comparing antioxidant defences in vegetarian and non-vegetarian athletes.",

      "abstract": "With the growing interest in the potential health benefits of plant-based diets, it is relevant to consider whether vegetarian dietary practices could influence athletic performance. Accordingly, this review examines whether nutrients that may differ between vegetarian and omnivorous diets could affect physical performance. We also describe recent studies that attempt to assess the effects of a vegetarian diet on performance and comment on other nutritional aspects of vegetarianism of relevance to athletes. Although well-controlled long-term studies assessing the effects of vegetarian diets on athletes have not been conducted, the following observations can be made: 1) well-planned, appropriately supplemented vegetarian diets appear to effectively support athletic performance; 2) provided protein intakes are adequate to meet needs for total nitrogen and the essential amino acids, plant and animal protein sources appear to provide equivalent support to athletic training and performance; 3) vegetarians (particularly women) are at increased risk for non-anemic iron deficiency, which may limit endurance performance; and 4) as a group, vegetarians have lower mean muscle creatine concentrations than do omnivores, and this may affect supramaximal exercise performance. Because their initial muscle creatine concentrations are lower, vegetarians are likely to experience greater performance increments after creatine loading in activities that rely on the adenosine triphosphate/phosphocreatine system. 5) Coaches and trainers should be aware that some athletes may adopt a vegetarian diet as a strategy for weight control. Accordingly, the possibility of a disordered eating pattern should be investigated if a vegetarian diet is accompanied by unwarranted weight loss.",

      "abstract": "The effect of creatine supplementation on exercise performance in vegetarians was examined. Creatine was ingested for 1 week by a group of vegetarians (VC) and meat-eaters (MC); a control group of meat-eaters was fed only glucose (MG). Exercise performance during three, 20-s maximal cycling tests (modified Wingate anaerobic test, WAnT) was determined before and after creatine supplementation. Blood samples were also drawn before and after exercise prior to and after supplementation. Basal plasma creatine (after an overnight fast) averaged (SE) 11 (2) μM in VC, and 24 (2) and 23 (7) μM in MG and MC, respectively (P < 0.05 for VC vs meat-eaters). These findings were expected, since most of the body's exogenous creatine source is meat. There was no significant difference in any other parameter between groups prior to supplementation. Creatine feedings significantly increased body mass (≅1 kg) and mean power output during the WAnTs (≅5%) to a similar extent in the VC and MC groups (P < 0.05–0.001). These parameters were not affected by supplementation in the MG group. Peak power output was also significantly increased by supplementation in MC (≅5%, P < 0.05), but not in VC. It is concluded that vegetarians and meat-eaters respond to creatine feedings with similar increases in mean power output during short-term, maximal exercise.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, interest in plant-based proteins has been rising due to ethical and sustainability issues. In this context, the production of protein concentrates and isolates from new plant sources have increased enormously because of their nutritional and techno-functional properties. Therefore, this work describes a pilot process for obtaining protein-rich ingredients from a yellow lupin variety (Lupinus luteus) developed by the Agriaquaculture Nutritional Genomic Center (CGNA). A protein alkaline solubilisation followed by isoelectric precipitation was used as a method for obtaining a protein concentrate (LPC) and isolate (LPI) with 75 and 95% protein, respectively. The changes in the protein quality and chemical composition during the protein concentration process from lupin flour were evaluated. Thus, nutritional parameters such as the amino acids (AAs) profile, essential amino acid index (EAAI), chemical score (CS), the protein efficiency ratio (PER), and digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) were determined to evaluate the nutritional quality of LPC and LPI. The facile and scalable protein isolation method without a defatting process proposed in this study showed a great protein separation efficiency (PSE), while the amino acids profile was not affected during both the concentration as well as the isolation of proteins. In addition, SDS-PAGE showed that both LPC and LPI mainly contained the high-molecular-weight proteins α and β-conglutins. Both LPC and LPI had a balanced amino acids profile, and arginine was the most predominant amino acid. These results are useful for increasing the use of lupin based-protein ingredients as a potential functional ingredient in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally (World Health Organisation, 2011). Many of the risk factors for CVD are modifiable, including overweight and obesity. Numerous strategies have been proposed to fight CVD, with a special focus being placed on dietary interventions for weight management. The literature suggests that two nutrients, fiber and protein, may play significant roles in weight control and hence cardiovascular health. Increasing both protein and fiber in the diet can be difficult because popular low-carbohydrate and high-protein diets tend to have considerably low-fiber intakes (Slavin, 2005). One approach to obtain both is to develop functional foods using unique ingredients. Lupin flour is a novel food ingredient derived from the endosperm of lupin. It contains 40–45% protein, 25–30% fiber, and negligible sugar and starch (Petterson and Crosbie, 1990). Research conducted to date reveals that lupin-enriched foods, which are naturally high in protein and fiber, may have a significant effect on CVD risk factors.

Spectrophotometry, spectroscopy, electrophoresis, calorimetry, chromatography, and mass spectrometry are confirmed to be the most effective methods for the identification of PPC. After glycosylation, functionalities of the native protein, including solubility, rheological properties, emulsifying properties, foaming properties, gel property, film-forming properties, thermal stability, antioxidant activity, allergenicity, and antibacterial properties, are improved. The PPC is extensively used as an encapsulation or a delivering material in order to improve the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds in food system. Some new applications in food processing could be explored using PPC as an ingredient based on the improved functional properties, such as 3-dimensional printing food, gelled food, and colloid food.

The emulsifying properties and foaming ability of the formed conjugates were also evaluated. Conjugates with pectin and Lz-CMC system showed an increase in the browning index with the increase of the heating time.

This prevents its application in various food systems and processing technologies. The conjugation of proteins with polysaccharides via the Maillard reaction is an efficient method to improve the functionality of proteins. The purpose of this work was to conjugate gum acacia (GA) with WPI via the dry‐heating Maillard reaction and to investigate the effect of reaction time on the physicochemical and functional properties of WPI‐GA conjugates.\n\nRESULTS\nSodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high‐performance size exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of higher molecular weight conjugates. The degrees of glycation for WPI‐GA conjugates incubated for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days were 28.14%, 44.98%, 49.50%, and 51.20%, respectively. The glycation reaction reduced the surface hydrophobicity and fluorescence intensity of WPI significantly (P  < 0.05). Functional properties of the conjugates, such as solubility, stability against heat‐induced insolubility, and emulsion properties were all superior to the control WPI. However, a reaction time longer than a day resulted in a high degree of browning and decreased the functionality of the conjugate significantly (P  < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results indicated that conjugation of WPI with GA can be a promising way to enhance its functional properties. However, the reaction time suitable for producing conjugates with superior functional properties was not necessarily the highest glycation degree that could be reached. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",

The results suggested that PPI intimately incorporated into GA after 1 day incubation, giving a non-homogeneous microstructure with a reduction of nearly 18% available free amino and an increase of relative solubility to 15.5%. Additionally, emulsions prepared by PPI-GA conjugates showed smaller particle size, higher surface charge, and stronger steric hindrance to stabilize the emulsion droplets against environmental stresses and lipid oxidation. The findings provide a practical means to improve the functionality of pea proteins.",

Techno-functional properties (emulsifying characteristics, solubility, and thermal stability) were evaluated for α-la, α-la/AG mixtures and α-la:AG conjugates. Conjugate thermal stability was improved compared to pure α-la treated at the same conditions of conjugate formation. Response surface methodology was used to establish models to predict solubility and emulsifying activity as functions of the salt concentration, pH and reaction time. α-la:AG conjugate solubility is affected in a complex manner by the three factors analyzed. Emulsifying activity index (EAI) of α-la is significantly affected by pH, while the α-la:AG EAI is affected by the three analyzed factors.

In some experiments WPI was removed from the continuous phase of the emulsions through repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the emulsion droplets (washed emulsion). Unwashed emulsions were more oxidatively stable than washed emulsions at pH 7.0, suggesting that continuous phase proteins were antioxidative. The oxidative stability of emulsions containing different kinds of protein in the continuous phase decreased in the order SPI > CAS > WPI, as determined by both hydroperoxide and headspace propanal formation.

The present article reviews novel biological materials that are used to design oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions. More specifically, the major focus is to discuss (o/w) interfaces stabilized by multiple biopolymers. Prevalent ways by which two or more emulsifiers could be combined is by (i) forming multi-layered emulsions and (ii) conjugation of two compounds of beneficial traits. Multilayer emulsions make use of a combination of protein, phospholipids, and carbohydrates to stabilize (o/w) interfaces. On the other hand, covalent bonding between a protein and polysaccharide is induced to form a single entity known as conjugate that is superior to the individual biopolymers in terms of emulsion stability. Therefore, properties required to maintain emulsion stability such as surface activity, solubility, steric and electrostatic repulsion, and antioxidant effects from two different hydrocolloids could be integrated.",

The physical properties and oxidative stability of emulsions stabilized by the native SPI–RES and heated SPI–RES complexes were evaluated. The water solubility of RES was enhanced by complexation with SPI, which was mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions. Heat treatment favoured the formation of the SPI–RES complex and endowed it with a higher antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the emulsions stabilized by the SPI–RES complexes showed an increased oxidative stability with reduced lipid hydroperoxides and volatile hexanal. This improving effect could be attributed to the targeted accumulation of RES at the oil–water interface accompanied by the adsorption of SPI, as evidenced by the high interfacial RES concentration.

The physical properties and oxidative stability of SPI emulsions with STE/STE–RES were evaluated. The water solubility of RES increased with the increase of STE concentration up to its critical micelle concentration, suggesting the solubilization of hydrophobic RES in STE self-assembled micelles. STE micelles competitively adsorbed at the oil–water interface with SPI, forming a mixed SPI and STE interfacial layer, thus resulting in a decrease in particle size and evident enhancement in the physical stability of SPI-based emulsions. After the incorporation of STE–RES, SPI emulsions showed an enhanced oxidative stability with reduced lipid hydroperoxides and volatile hexanal. This improvement was believed to be mainly attributed to the targeted migration of RES to the interface during the adsorption of the STE–RES complex, as evidenced by high interfacial accumulation of RES.",

The knowledge about the structure–function relationships of these proteins is crucial for their applications, but still very scant, especially that on their molecular mechanism of emulsification. The purpose of this review is to present a comprehensive summary of the knowledge about emulsifying and interfacial properties of soy proteins, achieved during the past decades, and particularly to provide an insight in understanding the role of conformational flexibility in their emulsifying properties. The interplays between the emulsifying and interfacial properties are also elucidated. For these proteins, the conformational flexibility rather than the surface hydrophobicity is the crucial parameter determining their emulsification performance. On the other hand, evidence is fast growing to indicate that because of the insoluble nature, soy proteins are a kind of unique materials to perform as food-grade Pickering stabilizers. The knowledge about the Pickering emulsion stabilization is distinctly different from that for conventional emulsions stabilized by soy proteins. Thus, different strategies should be employed to develop soy proteins into a kind of effective emulsifiers, depending on the preference of emulsification performance or emulsion stability.",

      "abstract": "This review summarizes a large set of related experimental results about protein adsorption and drop coalescence in emulsions, stabilized by globular milk proteins, β-lactoglobulin (BLG) or whey protein concentrate (WPC). First, we consider the effect of drop coalescence on the mean drop size, d32, during emulsification. Two regimes of emulsification, surfactant-rich (negligible drop coalescence) and surfactant-poor (significant drop coalescence) are observed in all systems studied. In the surfactant-rich regime, d32 does not depend on emulsifier concentration and is determined mainly by the interfacial tension and the power dissipation density in the emulsification chamber, ε. In the surfactant-poor regime and suppressed electrostatic repulsion, d32 is a linear function of the inverse initial emulsifier concentration, 1 / CINI, which allows one to determine the threshold emulsifier adsorption needed to stabilize the oil drops during emulsification, Γ⁎ (the latter depends neither on oil volume fraction nor on ε). Second, we study how the BLG adsorption on drop surface changes while varying the protein and electrolyte concentrations, and pH of the aqueous phase. At low electrolyte concentrations, the protein adsorbs in a monolayer. If the pH is away from the isoelectric point (IEP), the electrostatic repulsion keeps the adsorbed BLG molecules separated from each other, which precludes the formation of strong intermolecular bonds during shelf-storage as well as after heating of the emulsion. At higher electrolyte concentration, the adsorption Γ increases, as a result of suppressed electrostatic repulsion between the protein molecules; monolayer or multilayer is formed, depending on protein concentration and pH. The adsorption passes through a maximum (around the protein IEP) as a function of pH. Third, the effect of various factors on the coalescence stability of “fresh” emulsions (up to several hours after preparation) was studied. Important conclusion from this part of the study is the establishment of three different cases of emulsion stabilization: (1) electrostatically-stabilized emulsions with monolayer adsorption, whose stability is described by the DLVO theory; (2) emulsions stabilized by steric repulsion, created by protein adsorption multilayers — a simple model was adapted to describe the stability of these emulsions; and (3) emulsions stabilized by steric repulsion, created by adsorption monolayers. Fourth, we studied how the emulsion stability changes with storage time and after heating. At high electrolyte concentrations, we find a significant decrease of the coalescence stability of BLG-emulsions after one day of shelf-storage (aging effect). The results suggest that aging is related to conformational changes in the protein adsorption layer, which lead to formation of extensive lateral non-covalent bonds (H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions) between the adsorbed molecules. The heating of BLG emulsions at high electrolyte concentration leads to strong increase of emulsion stability and to disappearance of the aging effect, which is explained by the formation of disulfide bonds between the adsorbed molecules. The emulsion heating at low electrolyte concentration does not affect emulsion stability — this result is explained with the electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbed molecules, which keeps them separated so that no intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed. Parallel experiments with WPC-stabilized emulsions show that these emulsions are less sensitive to variations of pH and thermal treatment; no aging effect is detected up to 30 days of storage. The observed differences between BLG and WPC are explained with the different procedures of preparation of these protein samples (freeze-drying and thermally enhanced spray-drying, respectively). Our data for emulsion coalescence stability are compared with literature results about the flocculation stability of BLG emulsions, and the observed similarities/differences are explained by considering the structure of the protein adsorption layers.",

But because of blocking phenolic compounds within dispersed emulsions droplets, thermal stability of encapsulated OLE was lower. To summarize, with increased solubility and controlled release of olive leaf phenolic compounds through their nano-encapsulation, a higher antioxidant activity was achieved.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic interfacial tension (DIFT) at oil–water interface, diffusion coefficients, surface hydrophobicity, zeta potential and emulsifying properties, including emulsion activity index (EAI), emulsion stability index (ESI) and droplet size of lentil protein isolate (LPI), were measured at different pH and LPI concentration, in order to elucidate its emulsifying behaviour. Sodium caseinate (NaCas), whey protein isolate (WPI), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (Lys) were used as benchmark proteins and their emulsifying property was compared with that of LPI. The speed of diffusion-controlled migration of these proteins to the oil/water interface, was in the following order: NaCas > LPI > WPI > BSA > Lys, while their surface hydrophobicity was in the following order: BSA > LPI > NaCas > WPI > Lys. The EAI of emulsions stabilised by the above proteins ranged from 90.3 to 123.3 m2/g and it was 93.3 ± 0.2 m2/g in LPI-stabilised emulsion. However, the stability of LPI-stabilised emulsions was slightly lower compared to that of WPI and NaCas-stabilised emulsions at the same protein concentration at pH 7.0. The ESI of LPI emulsions improved substantially with decrease in droplet size when protein concentration was increased (20–30 mg/ml). Reduction of disulphide bonds enhanced both the EAI and ESI compared to untreated samples. Heat treatment of LPI dispersions resulted in poor emulsion stability due to molecular aggregation. The stability of LPI-stabilised emulsions was found to decrease in the presence of NaCl. This study showed that LPI can be as effective emulsifiers of oil-in-water emulsions as are WPI and NaCas at ⩾20 mg/ml concentrations both at low and neutral pH. The emulsifying property of LPI can be improved by reducing the intra and inter-disulphide bond by using appropriate reducing agents.",

      "abstract": "The physical stability of emulsions containing bioactive ingredients is an important aspect of functional food development. This research investigated the effects of a bioactive dairy hydrolysate with anti-inflammatory effects on the properties of oil-in-water emulsions (23% rapeseed oil and 1.5% w/w protein). This was determined by monitoring the effects of various combinations of sodium caseinate (NaCas) and NaCas hydrolysate (NaCasH) (NaCas : NaCasH; 100 : 0, 40 : 60, 30 : 70, 20 : 80 and 0 : 100) on the physico-chemical characteristics (particle size distribution, microstructure, adsorption of protein to the interface, viscosity and creaming stability) of emulsions. Currently, there is growing interest in designing functional foods that modulate lipid digestion. Therefore, emulsion breakdown and subsequent release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from selected NaCasH stabilised emulsions (40 : 60 and 0 : 100) was monitored during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and compared to the behaviour of emulsions stabilised by NaCas alone. Inclusion of NaCasH generally decreased the stability of the emulsions except when added at a NaCas : NaCasH ratio of 40 : 60 which resulted in emulsions with equivalent stability to the NaCas stabilised emulsions. Although the 40 : 60 combination provided an emulsion system as stable as NaCas, during simulated digestion, these emulsions demonstrated a slower rate of FFA release. This was attributed to the 40 : 60 stabilised emulsions having much larger flocculated lipid droplets than NaCas emulsions, which resulted in reduced surface area and fewer binding sites for lipase adsorption. Accordingly, the 40 : 60 emulsions were hydrolysed more slowly. Emulsions containing only NaCasH exhibited extensive coalescence prior to and during digestion and thus displayed the slowest release of FFA. The results suggest that including NaCasH in the emulsifier blend yields emulsions with modified digestibility and may form the basis of controlling the digestion and release of fat-soluble nutrients in formulated foods. However, further studies are required to optimise the stability of these emulsions before inclusion in such applications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Rice bran oil (RBO) is used in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals due to its desirable health, flavor, and functional attributes. We investigated the effects of biopolymer emulsifier type and environmental stresses on the stability of RBO emulsions. Oil‐in‐water emulsions (5% RBO, 10 mM citrate buffer) stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI), gum arabic (GA), or modified starch (MS) were prepared using high‐pressure homogenization. The new MS used had a higher number of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) groups per starch molecule than conventional MS. The droplet diameters produced by WPI and MS were considerably smaller (d < 300 nm) than those produced by GA (d > 1000 nm). The influence of pH (3 to 8), ionic strength (0 to 500 mM NaCl), and thermal treatment (30 to 90 °C) on the physical stability of the emulsions was examined. Extensive droplet aggregation occurred in WPI‐stabilized emulsions around their isoelectric point (4 < pH < 6), at high salt (> 200 mM, pH 7), and at high temperatures (>70 °C, pH 7, 150 mM NaCl), which was attributed to changes in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between droplets. There was little effect of pH, ionic strength, and temperature on emulsions stabilized by GA or MS, which was attributed to strong steric stabilization. In summary: WPI produced small droplets at low concentrations, but they had poor stability to environmental stress; GA produced large droplets and needed high concentrations, but they had good stability to stress; new MS produced small droplets at low concentrations, with good stability to stress.\n\nPractical Application: This study showed that stable rice bran oil‐in‐water emulsions can be formed using biopolymer emulsifiers. These emulsions could be used to incorporate RBO into a wide range of food products. We compared the relative performance of whey protein, GA, and a new MS at forming and stabilizing the emulsions. The new OSA MS was capable of forming small stable droplets at relatively low concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Milk constituents [caseins, whey proteins (WP), lactose, and anhydrous milk fat] are used widely in the manufacture of dehydrated dairy and dairy-like emulsions. When sodium caseinate- (NaCas) and WP-stabilized emulsions with an oil-to-protein ratio ranging from 0.25 to 5 are dehydrated, NaCas is a more effective encapsulant than WP because of its superior emulsifying properties and resistance to heat denaturation. Denaturation degree of WP during drying has been associated with increased powder surface fat and larger droplet size after reconstitution. Encapsulation of NaCas-stabilized emulsions improves in the presence of lactose; powder surface fat was reduced from 30 to <5% when lactose was added at a 1:1 ratio to NaCas in an emulsion containing 30% (wt/wt) oil. This has been related to the ability of lactose to form solid-like (or glassy) capsules during sudden dehydration. Encapsulation of WP-stabilized emulsions is not improved by addition of lactose, although there are conflicting reports in the literature. Storage stability of dehydrated dairy-like emulsions is strongly linked to lactose crystallization as release of encapsulated material occurs during storage at high relative humidities (e.g., 75%). The use of alternative carbohydrates as “matrix-forming” materials (such as maltodextrins or gum arabic) improves storage stability but compromises the emulsion droplet size after reconstitution. The composition of the powder surface has been recognized as a key parameter in dehydrated emulsion quality. It is the chemical composition of the powder surface that dictates the behavior of the bulk in terms of wettability, flowability, and stability. Analyses, using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis of the surface of industrial milk powders and dehydrated emulsions that mimicked the composition of milk, showed that powder surface is covered mainly by fat, even when the fat content is very low (18 and 99% surface fat coverage for skim milk and whole milk powders, respectively). The functional properties of milk constituents during emulsion dehydration are far from being thoroughly understood; future research needs include a) the encapsulation properties of pure micellar casein; b) a deeper understanding of colloidal phenomena (such as changes in the oil-water and air-oil interfaces) that occur before, during, and after dehydration, which ultimately define emulsion stability after drying; and c) reconciliation of the current different views on powder surface composition.",

Conjugates were prepared via Maillard reaction at 40 and 50 °C, pH 7, and aw = 0.44. The progress of the Maillard reaction was followed by indirect formation of Amadori and Heyns compounds, advanced glycation end products, and brown polymers. The structural characterization of glycoconjugates was conducted by using a number of analytical techniques such as RP-HPLC, isoelectric focusing, MALDI-ToF, SDS−PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and spectrofluorimetry (tryptophan fluorescence). In addition, the surface hydrophobicity of the β-lactoglobulin glycoconjugates was also assessed. The results showed a higher reactivity of galactose than tagatose to form the glycoconjugates, probably due to the higher electrophilicity of the aldehyde group. At 40 °C, more aggregation was produced when β-lactoglobulin was conjugated with tagatose as compared to galactose. However, at 50 °C hardly any difference was observed in the aggregation produced by galactose and tagatose. These results afford more insight into the importance of the functional group of the carbohydrate moiety during the formation of protein−carbohydrate conjugates via Maillard reaction.",

Interfacial complexation between protein and polysaccharide may occur through covalent bonding or electrostatic bonding.

Recently, the effects of melanoidins on human health and the chemical characterization of the beneficial components have gained a lot of attention, and their implications on several levels, sensory, nutritional, toxicological and technological were investigated. Food melanoidins have been reported to be anionic, coloured compounds, and some of their key chromophores have been elucidated. The antioxidant activity and other biological effects of melanoidins from real foods and model systems have been widely studied. Despite this, very few different melanoidin structures have actually been described, and specific health effects have yet to be linked with chemically distinct melanoidins. The variety of Maillard reaction products formed during the reaction, in conjunction with the difficulty in purifying and identifying them, makes a thorough analysis of melanoidins challenging.",

      "abstract": "The effects of Maillard reaction on gel properties of dried egg white (DEW) with galactomannan (GM) were investigated. Maillard-reacted DEW (MDEW) was prepared by dry-heating a mixture with a weight ratio of 1:4 of GM to DEW at 60 °C and 65% relative humidity. The modification of amino groups and polymerization of DEW proteins dry-heated with GM proceeded with increasing the dry-heating time. The covalent attachment of GM to DEW was confirmed from SDS−PAGE analysis. Gel strength and water-holding capacity of MDEW gels were higher than those of DEW dry-heated without GM (control DEW) and reached maximum after 3 days of dry-heating. The appearance of MDEW gels became transparent with increasing the dry-heating time, but control DEW gels were still turbid. MDEW dry-heated for 3 days was almost soluble even after heating of its solution at 90 °C, whereas control DEW proteins precipitated. The modification of DEW with GM through the Maillard reaction was an effective method to make a firm and transparent gel from DEW at broader range of pH and NaCl concentration of the medium.",

Lactose led to the lowest degree of modification without significant differences by reaction time and by protein:sugar molar ratio. However, in the case of glucose, the degree of glycation increases with reaction time and molar ratio. The results obtained by UV fluorescence, surface hydrophobicity and differential scanning calorimetry clearly showed differences in the degree of folding of β-lactoglobulin upon modification with different sugars or thermal treatment, with changes in the foaming capacity of β-lactoglobulin. All the modified samples exhibited a significant increase (α ⩽ 0.05) in draining stability (Kg) as compared to the non-thermally treated sample. In addition, foams formed by lactose-glycated samples were more stable than those formed by glucose-glycated ones. A significant increase (α ⩽ 0.05) of foam stability with reaction time was also detected, particularly in glucose-glycated samples.",

      "abstract": "Protein-reducing sugar conjugates are formed by the naturally occurring Maillard reaction, otherwise known as glycation. The Maillard reaction products (MRP) formed can provide novel and/or improved functionality compared to the unmodified protein. Understanding the chemistry of the Maillard reaction, the physicochemical properties of its products, and, more importantly, the inter-relationships between these properties and the specific functionality of a given MRP will help to define the potential of MRP as food ingredients in their own right. Recently, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) have acquired a leading role in the structural characterization of proteins. The ability of these techniques to provide detail about the nature and extent of protein modifications at a molecular level as well as conformational information provides new insight into the glycation process.

The percent blocked lysine, estimated from the furosine content, reached a maximum value of 11.2% for LZM:galactan conjugates after 1 day incubation at a aw of 0.65. A maximum percent blocked lysine of 7.0 and 13.5% were obtained for LZM:galactose/GOS conjugates at a lower aw of 0.45 after 3 and 7 days, respectively. However, the low percent blocked lysine and the high protein aggregation index of LZM:galactose/GOS conjugates at aw 0.79 and 0.65 revealed the prevalence of the degradation of the Amadori compounds and the protein cross-linking. Mass spectrometry of LZM conjugates revealed the formation of different glycoforms. Glycated LZMs containing up to seven galactose moieties were formed; while only mono- and diglycated LZMs with GOSs were detected. 2–3 mol of galactan were conjugated to 1 mol of LZM. Response surface methodology, based on a 5-level and 3-factor central composite design, revealed that molar ratio and temperature were the most significant variables for the glycation of LZM with GOSs. The optimal conditions leading to a high percent blocked lysine (16.11%) with a low protein aggregation index (0.11) were identified: temperature of 49.5 °C, LZM:GOS molar ratio of 1:9 and aw of 0.65.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in healthful foods and are open to soy protein ingredients. Soybeans as food are very versatile and a rich source of essential nutrients. They are also an excellent source of good‐quality protein, comparable to other protein foods, and suitable for all ages. Adverse nutritional and other undesirable effects followed by the consumption of raw soybean meal have been attributed to the presence of endogenous inhibitors of digestive enzymes and lectins, as well as poor digestibility. To improve the nutritional quality of soy foods, inhibitors and lectins are generally inactivated by heat or eliminated by fractionation during food processing. Soybeans provide an alternative source of protein for people who are allergic to milk protein. Soy protein is highly digestible (92% to 100%) and contains all essential amino acids. Although relatively low in methionine, it is a good source of lysine. Soy‐protein products contain a high concentration of isoflavones, up to 1 g/kg. Increased acceptance of soy proteins is due to unmatched qualities like good functional properties in food applications, high nutritional quality, abundance, availability, and low cost. At present the various forms of soy proteins are primarily utilized for their functional effects rather than their nutritional properties. This article summarizes the integrated overview of the widely available, scattered information about the nutritional and functional uses of the soy proteins when applied in food systems and intends to present the most current knowledge with an interest to stimulate further research to optimize their beneficial effects.",

      "abstract": "The influence of dextran molecular weight on the steric layer thickness and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion flocculation stability of β-lactoglobulin–dextran Maillard conjugates was investigated. Maillard conjugates were formed by reacting β-lactoglobulin with various molecular weight dextrans () under mild conditions (60 °C, 76% RH). Purified Maillard conjugates or β-lactoglobulin were adsorbed onto latex spheres and the thickness of the adsorbed layer measured using photon correlation spectroscopy. The adsorbed layer thickness was 3 nm for β-lactoglobulin alone. Attachment of dextran increased adsorbed layer thickness to 5 nm for the conjugate with low molecular weight dextran () and 20 nm for that with high molecular weight dextran (). Enzymatic digestion of the adsorbed layers with dextranase reduced the layer to a thickness corresponding to that of β-lactoglobulin alone. This suggests that the protein segment of the Maillard conjugate anchors the emulsifier to the interface. Attachment of dextran, irrespective of its molecular weight (18.5–440 kDa), increased the stability of emulsions against calcium induced flocculation, demonstrating that a low molecular weight dextran is sufficient for imparting high steric stability. The observation that the steric layer size was controlled by the dextran molecular weight, suggests that the results of layer thickness and emulsion stability should be universal across all globular proteins.",

ASSP−dextran conjugates were prepared through the Maillard reaction to increase the solubility and/or dispersibility of ASSP. By using the conjugates and ultrasonication emulsification, stable oil-in-water emulsions with submicrometer-sized droplets were obtained. The factors, such as ASSP conjugation degree, that influence the emulsion stability were investigated. The emulsions were characterized using dynamic light scattering, ζ-potential, and atomic force microscopy. In the ultrasonication process, the increases of surface activity and aggregation of protein result in the formation of stable oil−water interface films. The dextran molecules conjugated to the protein effectively enhance the hydrophilicity and steric repulsion of the oil droplets, and therefore the emulsions are stable against heat treatment, long-term storage, and changes of pH and ionic strength. It was further verified that using protein−polysaccharide conjugates and ultrasonication emulsification is a versatile method for preparing stable emulsions.",

      "abstract": "Corn fiber arabinoxylan is hemicellulose B isolated from the fibrous portions (pericarp, tip cap, and endosperm cell wall fractions) of corn kernels and is commonly referred to as corn fiber gum (CFG). Our previous studies showed that CFG isolated from corn bran (a byproduct of corn dry milling) contains very little protein and is an inferior emulsifier for oil-in-water emulsion systems as compared to corn fiber gum isolated from corn fiber derived from the corn wet-milling process. The protein deficient CFG isolated from corn bran was covalently conjugated with byproducts of cheese processing, β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and whey protein isolate (WPI) using an economical food-grade Maillard-type heating reaction for the purpose of increasing their commercialization potential as a food emulsifier and soluble nutritional additive in beverages. The formation of the CFG–protein conjugates has been confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It has also been demonstrated that CFG–protein conjugates are capable of producing fine emulsions with better stability than either CFG or protein alone. The molecular characterization of CFG–protein conjugates was performed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled to on-line multi-angle laser light scattering and viscometric detection. The analysis by HPSEC revealed that CFG–protein conjugates had higher weight-average molar mass (Mw, 340–359 kDa) and polydispersity (Mw/Mn, 1.74) than the corresponding unconjugated CFG (Mw, 290 kDa and Mw/Mn, 1.35). The z-average root-mean-square radius of gyration (Rgz) of CFG–protein conjugates was slightly higher (30.5–33.5 nm) in comparison to CFG (29.5 nm) but their weight-average-intrinsic viscosity (η) remained unchanged (about 1.32 dL g−1). The Mark–Houwink exponent “a” of conjugates (0.40) was lower than the unconjugated CFG (0.53) indicating the formation of a more compact structure after conjugation with protein. These findings should benefit the beverage industry, which can use this information to produce a high quality emulsifier from the low-value byproducts of corn dry milling and cheese processing.",

The SSPS and SPI might conjugate via the Maillard reaction according to the results of grafting degree, color change, and infrared analyses. The main interactions during the formation of SPI gel changed from non-covalent to electrostatic interaction after adding SSPS. Sulfhydryl group content also increased in both cooked SPI and SPI gel. The water-holding capacity and gel strength of SPI gel decreased as the SSPS concentration increased.

It is of particular importance that psychovegetative climacteric complaints such as hot flushes are, if at all, only slightly influenced by isoflavones. The substances appear to have weak anti-osteoporotic effect. Their anti-atherosclerotic action is debatable, as not all authors find any beneficial effect on lipids.

Soy protein content of another essential amino acid, lysine, although higher than that of wheat proteins, is still lower than that of the milk protein casein.

To improve the nutritional quality of soy foods, inhibitors and lectins are generally inactivated by heat treatment or eliminated by fractionation during food processing. Although lectins are heat-labile, the inhibitors are more heat-stable than the lectins. Most commercially heated meals retain up to 20% of the Bowman−Birk (BBI) inhibitor of chymotrypsin and trypsin and the Kunitz inhibitor of trypsin (KTI). To enhance the value of soybeans in human nutrition and health, a better understanding is needed of the factors that impact the nutrition and health-promoting aspects of soy proteins. This paper discusses the composition in relation to properties of soy proteins. Also described are possible beneficial and adverse effects of soy-containing diets. The former include soy-induced lowering of cholesterol, anticarcinogenic effects of BBI, and protective effects against obesity, diabetes, irritants of the digestive tract, bone, and kidney diseases, whereas the latter include poor digestibility and allergy to soy proteins. Approaches to reduce the concentration of soybean inhibitors by rearrangement of protein disulfide bonds, immunoassays of inhibitors in processed soy foods and soybean germplasm, the roles of phytoestrogenic isoflavones and lectins, and research needs in all of these areas are also discussed. This integrated overview of the widely scattered literature emphasizes general concepts based on our own studies as well as recent studies by others. It is intended to stimulate interest in further research to optimize beneficial effects of soy proteins. The payoff will be healthier humans and improved animal feeds.",

The values of the degradation limit revealed that the soybean pectic polysaccharides comprise regions of galacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan carrying side chains composed mainly of homogeneous arabinan and galactan.

      "abstract": "Eight healthy young men participated in a metabolic balance study designed to assess the protein quality of soy protein concentrate (STAPRO-3200). Subjects received varying intakes of the test protein [0.35, 0.45, 0.55 and 0.65 g protein (N × 6.25) per kilogram body weight per day] during 10-day experimental periods. Each was preceded by a 1-day protein-free diet. A final diet period with a 0.65 g milk protein intake was included for comparative purposes. During this period and that with the 0.65 g test intake of soy concentrate the stable isotopes 70Zn and 53Fe were added to the diet for 2 days to obtain initial data on the absorption of zinc and iron when soy concentrate was the sole source of protein intake. Mean (± SEM) intake of soy concentrate determined to be sufficient for N balance (including allowance of 5 mg N/kg per day for integumental and miscellaneous losses) was 95 (± 7) mg N/kg per day. Absorption of the extrinsic doses of labeled iron and zinc did not differ between the soy protein- and milk-based diets. Comparison of these data was made with findings obtained previously with other protein sources evaluated in the same way. The conclusion is that the capacity of the soy concentration to support short-term nitrogen equilibrium in adult protein nutrition is the same as that for good quality animal protein sources. Thus, well-processed soy concentrates can make a nutritionally significant contribution to meeting adult human protein needs.",

On the basis of a PER value of 2.50 for casein, the PER of the textured food and of natural dehydrated beef was 2.30 and 2.34, respectively. Highest weight gain was obtained with diets containing 16.7 and 16.3% protein, from the soybean protein textured food and casein, respectively. NPU values were 62.6 for case in and 59.1% for the soybean protein textured food. Heating of the soybean protein textured food increased weight gain but not the PER. Heating of the protein isolate and of the fiber made from it improved both. Apparently this treatment caused the elimination of adverse physiological factors inherent in soybean, or the removal of substances in the product derived from the preparation process. At the 10% protein level, supplementation with lysine and methionine added together, but not alone, improved protein quality. Growth and nitrogen balance studies with dogs indicated that the soybean protein textured food had essentially the same protein quality as that of dehydrated beef. True protein digestibility and biological value were 92.3 and 65.3%, respectively, for the soybean protein textured food, and 87.0 and 67.4% for the dehydrated beef. The results in children show that, at a protein intake level of 2 g/kg/day, no difference in quality was evident between skim milk and the soybean protein textured food. Nitrogen equilibrium was obtained when the children received approximately 138 mg of nitrogen from the soybean protein textured food, as compared with 97 mg from milk. The true protein digestibility and biological value was 92.3 and 65.3%, respectively. It was concluded that the protein quality of the soybean protein textured food was about 80% of that from milk.

Throughout, nitrogen balances were measured, and at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks, blood chemistries were determined, and evaluations of physical performance were undertaken. In addition measurements were made of zinc absorption and balance and of iron absorption, with the aid of 70Zn and 55Fe. Mean nitrogen balances were slightly positive for all subjects and the protein source was judged to support adequately maintenance of protein nutritional status, confirmed by the absence of changes in relevant blood parameters and maintenance of performance in the exercise tests. Mean zinc absorption was 23% of intake and did not change during the 82-day soy period and crude zinc balances remained slightly positive throughout. Iron intake was solely from the soy concentrate, and each meal was supplemented with ascorbic acid. Iron absorption was highly variable between and within subjects, as determined by the stable isotope balance procedure. Associated with the withdrawal of blood for purposes of monitoring the subjects, serum ferritin declined indicating a reduction in iron stores. These blood changes were used to approximate iron absorption and it was estimated to be 16%.

Many of the major diseases of Western populations are hormone dependent and epidemiologic data have shown a strong association between their incidence and diet. In particular, the importance of a plant-based diet is evident from the current dietary recommendations that emphasize an increase in the proportion and amount of fruit and vegetables that should be consumed. Although interpretation of the role of individual components of the diet is difficult from epidemiologic and dietary studies, it is recognized that there are many plant-derived bioactive nonnutrients that can confer significant health benefits. Among these phytochemicals is the broad class of nonsteroidal estrogens called phytoestrogens, and in the past decade there has been considerable interest in the role of isoflavones because of their relatively high concentrations in soy protein. The isoflavones in modest amounts of ingested soy protein are biotransformed by intestinal microflora, are absorbed, undergo enterohepatic recycling, and reach circulating concentrations that exceed by several orders of magnitude the amounts of endogenous estrogens. These phytoestrogens and their metabolites have many potent hormonal and nonhormonal activities that may explain some of the biological effects of diets rich in phytoestrogens.",

Interestingly, the aglycone forms showed much smaller degradation as compared to glucoside forms at all the storage temperatures studied.

Blood samples and total urine were collected at intervals for the measurement of daidzein and genistein with HPLC.

Elimination half-lives were 4.7 +/- 1.1 and 5.7 +/- 1.3 h for daidzein and genistein, respectively. The slow increase in plasma concentrations is consistent with the facilitation of absorption by hydrolysis in the small and large intestines of the glycosidic forms of the isoflavones present in soybean-containing foods to their corresponding aglycones. The rate of urinary excretion of daidzein was greater than that of genistein throughout the postmeal period, with mean recoveries of 62 +/- 6% and 22 +/- 4% (P < 0.001) for daidzein and genistein, respectively. However, the ratio of the areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves for genistein and daidzein was equal to the ratio of the concentrations of the respective isoflavones in the soy meal.

      "abstract": "▪ Abstract Phytosterols are cholesterol-like molecules found in all plant foods, with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. They are absorbed only in trace amounts but inhibit the absorption of intestinal cholesterol including recirculating endogenous biliary cholesterol, a key step in cholesterol elimination. Natural dietary intake varies from about 167–437 mg/day. Attempts to measure biological effects in feeding studies have been impeded by limited solubility in both water and fat. Esterification of phytosterols with long-chain fatty acids increases fat solubility by 10-fold and allows delivery of several grams daily in fatty foods such as margarine. A dose of 2 g/day as the ester reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10%, and little difference is observed between Δ5-sterols and 5α-reduced sterols (stanols). Phytosterols can also be dispersed in water after emulsification with lecithin and reduce cholesterol absorption when added to nonfat foods. In contrast to these supplementation studies, much less is known about the effect of low phytosterol levels in the natural diet. However, reduction of cholesterol absorption can be measured at a dose of only 150 mg during otherwise sterol-free test meals, suggesting that natural food phytosterols may be clinically important. Current literature suggests that phytosterols are safe when added to the diet, and measured absorption and plasma levels are very small. Increasing the aggregate amount of phytosterols consumed in a variety of foods may be an important way of reducing population cholesterol levels and preventing coronary heart disease.",

In addition to their cholesterol lowering properties, plant sterols possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenicity, and anti-oxidation activities, and should thus be of clinical importance, even for those individuals without elevated LDL cholesterol. The carotenoid lowering effect of plant sterols should be corrected by increasing intake of food that is rich in carotenoids. In pregnant and lactating women and children, further study is needed to verify the dose required to decrease blood cholesterol without affecting fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoid status.",

In contrast in Western countries beans tend to play only a minor dietary role despite the fact that they are low in fat and are excellent sources of protein, dietary fiber, and a variety of micronutrients and phytochemicals. Soybeans are unique among the legumes because they are a concentrated source of isoflavones. Isoflavones have weak estrogenic properties and the isoflavone genistein influences signal transduction. Soyfoods and isoflavones have received considerable attention for their potential role in preventing and treating cancer and osteoporosis. The low breast cancer mortality rates in Asian countries and the putative antiestrogenic effects of isoflavones have fueled speculation that soyfood intake reduces breast cancer risk. The available epidemiologic data are limited and only weakly supportive of this hypothesis, however, particularly for postmenopausal breast cancer. The data suggesting that soy or isoflavones may reduce the risk of prostate cancer are more encouraging. The weak estrogenic effects of isoflavones and the similarity in chemical structure between soybean isoflavones and the synthetic isoflavone ipriflavone, which was shown to increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, suggest that soy or isoflavones may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Rodent studies tend to support this hypothesis, as do the limited preliminary data from humans.

Clinical studies have suggested that these health-promoting components, saponins, affect the immune system in ways that help to protect the human body against cancers, and also lower cholesterol levels. Saponins decrease blood lipids, lower cancer risks, and lower blood glucose response. A high saponin diet can be used in the inhibition of dental caries and platelet aggregation, in the treatment of hypercalciuria in humans, and as an antidote against acute lead poisoning. In epidemiological studies, saponins have been shown to have an inverse relationship with the incidence of renal stones. Thermal processing such as canning is the typical method to process beans. This study reviews the effect of thermal processing on the characteristics and stability of saponins in canned bean products. Saponins are thermal sensitive. During soaking and blanching, portions of saponins are dissolved in water and lost in the soaking, washing, and blanching liquors. An optimum thermal process can increase the stability and maintain the saponins in canned bean products, which is useful for assisting the food industry to improve thermal processing technology and enhance bean product quality.",

      "abstract": "The interactions between bioactive-rich food components within a complex human diet for the inhibition of prostate carcinogenesis are largely unknown and difficult to quantify in humans. Tomato and soy products have each shown anti-prostate cancer (PCa) activity in laboratory studies. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of dietary tomato and soy germ, alone and in combination, for the inhibition of PCa in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. At 4 weeks of age, male C57BL/6 × FVB TRAMP mice (n = 119) were randomized to consume: AIN-93G control, 10% whole tomato powder (TP), 2% soy germ powder (SG), or 10% tomato powder with 2% soy germ powder (TP+SG) for 14 weeks. One hundred percent of mice fed the control diet had PCa, whereas PCa incidence was significantly lower in mice consuming TP (61%, P < 0.001), SG (66%, P < 0.001), and TP+SG (45%, P < 0.001). Although the protection offered by the combination of TP and SG was not synergistic, it was the most effective intervention. TP, SG, and TP+SG increased apoptotic index (AI) and modestly reduced the proliferative index (PI) in the prostate epithelium of TRAMP mice exhibiting primarily prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The dramatic reduction in the PI/AI ratio by the dietary interventions suggests that the control mice experience a stronger stimulus for malignant progression in the prostate microenvironment. Maximally effective and safe strategies for PCa prevention may result from optimizing combinations of nutrients and bioactives through an orchestration of dietary patterns.

      "abstract": "Background: The effects of dietary soluble fibers on blood cholesterol are uncertain.\n\nObjective: This meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials was performed to quantify the cholesterol-lowering effect of major dietary fibers.\n\nDesign: Least-squares regression analyses were used to test the effect on blood lipids of pectin, oat bran, guar gum, and psyllium. Independent variables were type and amount of soluble fiber, initial cholesterol concentration, and other important study characteristics.\n\nResults: Soluble fiber, 2–10 g/d, was associated with small but significant decreases in total cholesterol [−0.045 mmol•L−1•g soluble fiber−1 (95% CI: −0.054, −0.035)] and LDL cholesterol [−0.057 mmol•L−1•g−1 (95% CI: −0.070, −0.044)]. The effects on plasma lipids of soluble fiber from oat, psyllium, or pectin were not significantly different. We were unable to compare effects of guar because of the limited number of studies using 2–10 g/d. Triacylglycerols and HDL cholesterol were not significantly influenced by soluble fiber. Lipid changes were independent of study design, treatment length, and background dietary fat content.\n\nConclusions: Various soluble fibers reduce total and LDL cholesterol by similar amounts. The effect is small within the practical range of intake. For example, 3 g soluble fiber from oats (3 servings of oatmeal, 28 g each) can decrease total and LDL cholesterol by <0.13 mmol/L. Increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution to dietary therapy to lower cholesterol.",

This scientific advisory assesses the more recent work published on soy protein and its component isoflavones. In the majority of 22 randomized trials, isolated soy protein with isoflavones, as compared with milk or other proteins, decreased LDL cholesterol concentrations; the average effect was &3%. This reduction is very small relative to the large amount of soy protein tested in these studies, averaging 50 g, about half the usual total daily protein intake. No significant effects on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), or blood pressure were evident. Among 19 studies of soy isoflavones, the average effect on LDL cholesterol and other lipid risk factors was nil. Soy protein and isoflavones have not been shown to lessen vasomotor symptoms of menopause, and results are mixed with regard to soy’s ability to slow postmenopausal bone loss. The efficacy and safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of the breast, endometrium, and prostate are not established; evidence from clinical trials is meager and cautionary with regard to a possible adverse effect. For this reason, use of isoflavone supplements in food or pills is not recommended. Thus, earlier research indicating that soy protein has clinically important favorable effects as compared with other proteins has not been confirmed. In contrast, many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat.",

Beyond adequate nutritional qualities, functional foods should either improve the state of health and wellbeing and/or reduce the risk of disease. Functional foods that are marketed with claims of heart disease reduction focus primarily on the major risk factors, i.e. cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension. Some of the most innovative products are designed to be enriched with ‘protective’ ingredients, believed to reduce risk. They may contain, for example, soluble fibre (from oat and psyllium), useful both for lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, or fructans, effective in diabetes. Phytosterols and stanols lower LDL-cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Soya protein is more hypocholesterolaemic in subjects with very high initial cholesterol and recent data indicate also favourable activities in the metabolic syndrome. n-3 Fatty acids appear to exert significant hypotriacylglycerolaemic effects, possibly partly responsible for their preventive activity. Dark chocolate is gaining much attention for its multifunctional activities, useful both for the prevention of dyslipidaemia as well as hypertension.

Sixty overweight subjects were randomly assigned to consume either 9.8 g/day of doenjang or placebo for 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric and metabolic parameters, along with abdominal fat distribution and PPAR-γ2 polymorphisms, were measured. Fifty-one subjects completed the study, doenjang (n=26) and placebo (n=25) groups. Relative frequencies of the PPAR-γ2 genotypes CC, TC, and TT were 70% (n=41), 25.9% (15), and 3.4% (2), whereas those of the PPAR-γ2 alleles C and T were 81.6% and 18.4%. Visceral fat area (VFA) was significantly decreased by doenjang supplementation in subjects with a mutant T allele of PPAR-γ2 compared to those with a C allele after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Plasma free fatty acid, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels were also significantly increased in the doenjang group. Doenjang pills significantly activated radical clearance capacity (ORAC and DNA tail length) in subjects with the C allele. The catalase (CAT) activity was increased twofold in the doenjang-treated group with the C allele, but this phenomenon was reversed in those with the T allele. Doenjang-treated subjects tended to have low dietary carbohydrate and sodium intakes compared with those given placebo. We found that doenjang supplementation decreased visceral fat accumulation and aging most effectively in subjects with PPAR-γ polymorphisms.

Most probiotics fall into the group of organisms’ known as lactic acid‐producing bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milks or other fermented foods. Some of the beneficial effect of lactic acid bacteria consumption include: (i) improving intestinal tract health; (ii) enhancing the immune system, synthesizing and enhancing the bioavailability of nutrients; (iii) reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals; and (iv) reducing risk of certain cancers. The mechanisms by which probiotics exert their effects are largely unknown, but may involve modifying gut pH, antagonizing pathogens through production of antimicrobial compounds, competing for pathogen binding and receptor sites as well as for available nutrients and growth factors, stimulating immunomodulatory cells, and producing lactase. Selection criteria, efficacy, food and supplement sources and safety issues around probiotics are reviewed. Recent scientific investigation has supported the important role of probiotics as a part of a healthy diet for human as well as for animals and may be an avenue to provide a safe, cost effective, and ‘natural’ approach that adds a barrier against microbial infection.

However, findings from epidemiological studies are equivocal. We investigated the relationships of a vegetarian diet and isoflavone intake with breast cancer risk in a cohort of 37,643 British women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, among whom there was considerable dietary heterogeneity because of the deliberate over‐sampling of individuals with meat‐free diets. Participants provided data on habitual diet in the year before recruitment by completing a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Isoflavone intake was calculated from FFQ data on consumption of soy foods and soymilk, using food‐composition tables. (There were precisely 585 breast cancer cases.) 585 women were diagnosed with breast cancer during 7.4 years of follow‐up. 31% of the population were vegetarian and, relative to nonvegetarians, the multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratio for breast cancer in vegetarians was 0.91 (95% CI 0.72–1.14). With the lowest intake group as the reference (median intake 0.2 mg/day), the multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios for those with a moderate (median intake 10.8 mg/day) or high intake of isoflavones (median intake 31.6 mg/day) were 1.08 (95% CI 0.85–1.38) and 1.17 (0.79–1.71), respectively. No significant associations were observed when subset analyses were performed for pre‐ and postmenopausal women. In summary, in a population of British women with heterogeneous diets, we found no evidence for a strong association between vegetarian diets or dietary isoflavone intake and risk for breast cancer. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The treatments were analyzed for color, pH, cooking loss, emulsion stability, protein solubility, viscosity, texture properties and sensory evaluation. Lightness and redness were reduced and yellowness was increased as increased level of WSP, due to the dark green color of WSP (p<0.05). The pH values of all samples were affected by WSP which has lower pH (p<0.05). The emulsion stability and cooking loss of treatments were improved with increasing level of WSP (p<0.05). The protein solubility, viscosity and overall texture properties of the sausage indicated significant differences in relation to the level of WSP and ISP (p<0.05). The sensory evaluation indicated that the greatest flavor and overall acceptability in sausage was achieved at WSP 1% combination with ISP 1% (T3) (p<0.05). Therefore, these results indicate that breakfast sausage containing 1% WSP and 1% ISP is the optimal formulation, taking into consideration the overall physico-chemical properties and sensory evaluation.",

Using the probability approach and diet modeling with data on 1678 adults from a representative French national dietary survey, we studied the sensitivity of the adequacy of protein and amino acid intakes to changes in animal:plant protein. We simulated the gradual substitution of AP with different mixtures of plant protein (PP), containing various proportions of PP already consumed and legumes, nuts and seeds (LNS). We found that protein and amino acid intakes met dietary requirements in virtually the entire population studied. Up to 50% of PP in diets, protein and amino acid intakes were adequate in all models. From 50%, protein inadequacy was primary due to protein quantity, and from 70%, to protein quality (as lysine inadequacy). The introduction of LNS in the mixture substituting AP led to adequate protein intakes for higher percentages of PP. An increase in PP based on the current pattern of plant protein sources, low in protein:energy, could lead to inadequate protein intake, but the contribution of LNS ensures the safety of a further transition.",

      "abstract": "Chickens are recognized as an imperative source of thermophilic Campylobacter spp., carrying this microorganism in high numbers in their intestinal tract. For long time, C. jejuni has been considered as a commensal microorganism which colonizes its primary host rather than infecting it, in the absence of any obvious clinical signs. However, recent studies question this and argue for a deeper understanding of the host-bacteria interaction. Following oral uptake it was demonstrated that C. jejuni interacts intimately with the gut epithelium and influences cellular functions of the host, with consequences on nutrient absorption. The immune reaction of the host which was revealed in some studies confirmed the infectious nature of C. jejuni. In agreement with this, an increased expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes was noticed. The ability to induce intestinal damages and to modulate the barrier function of the intestinal epithelia has further consequences on gut integrity, as it facilitates the paracellular passage of C. jejuni into the underlying tissues and it supports the translocation of luminal bacteria such as Escherichia coli to internal organs. This is associated with an alteration of the gut microbiota as infected birds have a significantly lower abundance of E. coli in different parts of the intestine. Some studies found that the gut microbiota influences the infection and translocation of C. jejuni in chickens by various ways. The effects of C. jejuni on the intestinal function of chickens already indicate a possible interference with animal performance and welfare which was confirmed in some experimental studies. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that a Campylobacter infection has an influence on the movement pattern of broiler flocks supporting experimental studies. The intense interaction of C. jejuni with the chicken supports its role as infectious agent instead of simply colonizing the gut. Most of the findings about the impact of Campylobacter on chickens are derived from studies using different Campylobacter isolates, a specific type of bird and varying experimental design. However, experimental studies demonstrate an influence of the 3 aforementioned parameters on the outcome of a certain trial arguing for improved standardization. This review summarizes the actual knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction of C. jejuni in chickens, emphasizing that there are still major gaps despite recently gained knowledge. Resolving the cascade from oral uptake to dissemination in the organism is crucial to fully elucidate the interaction of C. jejuni with the chicken host and to assess the clinical and economic implications with possible consequences on preventive interventions.",

Strict and expensive on-farm biosecurity measures have been largely unsuccessful in controlling infection and are hampered by the time needed to analyse faecal samples, with the result that Campylobacter status is often known only after a flock has been processed. Our data demonstrate an alternative approach that monitors the behaviour of live chickens with cameras and analyses the 'optical flow' patterns made by flock movements. Campylobacter-free chicken flocks have higher mean and lower kurtosis of optical flow than those testing positive for Campylobacter by microbiological methods. We show that by monitoring behaviour in this way, flocks likely to become positive can be identified within the first 7-10 days of life, much earlier than conventional on-farm microbiological methods. This early warning has the potential to lead to a more targeted approach to Campylobacter control and also provides new insights into possible sources of infection that could transform the control of this globally important food-borne pathogen.",

This paper assesses the predictive value of the presence of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chicken flocks when animal-based measures related to footpad dermatitis, hock burns, body lesions and arthritis are identified under commercial conditions (high density). The study population included 32 flocks analysed on farm and at slaughter, slaughtered between April and August 2008 in six different slaughter plants in Brittany, France. Welfare and health indicators are those indicated by the European legislation and sampling was carried out in the framework of the European baseline survey on the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler chicken. Caecal contents, sampled both on farm and at slaughter, and carcass skin samples from the neck and breast at slaughter, were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp. Logistic models/classification trees were used to estimate the probability of the presence (or absence) of a specific foodborne pathogen in a flock based on specific animal-based measures (or combinations of measures) in order to study the potential relationship between welfare indicators and foodborne pathogen prevalence/incidence levels. On farm, flocks with more than 25% animals with severe lesions on between 25 and 50% of the footpad are predicted to be Campylobacterpositive whereas flocks where less than 13 individuals have arthritis are predicted to be Campylobacter-negative. The error rate on farm and at slaughter was 10 and 4% respectively indicating good predicting abilities. A poor welfare environment may result in stress, which reduces chicken immunocompetence making them more susceptible to Campylobacter spp. An infection with Campylobacter spp may lead to impaired defence and susceptibility to other pathogens which may result in greater intestinal excretion. Poor welfare and high growing rate lead to digestive troubles that lead to litter humidity. Litter humidity that, among other things, causes footpad dermatitis may also influence the horizontal transmission of the Campylobacter spp. infection due to the normal coprophagic behaviour of poultry. Reducing welfare problems by a better management of rearing conditions would not only improve broiler welfare, but it would also decrease the risks of Campylobacter contamination, of carcass condemnations and of economic loss for the poultry industry.",

In general, the acute form of DON mycotoxicosis rarely occurs in poultry flocks under normal conditions. However, if diets contain low levels of DON (less than 5 mg DON/kg diet), lower productivity, impaired immunity and higher susceptibility to infectious diseases can occur. The molecular mechanism of action of DON has not been completely understood. A significant influence of DON in chickens is the impairment of immunological functions. It was known that low doses of DON elevated the serum IgA levels and affected both cell-mediated and humoral immunity in animals. DON is shown to suppress the antibody response to infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV) and to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in broilers (10 mg DON/kg feed) and laying hens (3.5 to 14 mg of DON/kg feed), respectively. Moreover, DON (10 mg DON/kg feed) decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the plasma of broilers. DON can severely affect the immune system and, due to its negative impact on performance and productivity, can\neventually result in high economic losses to poultry producers.

Newly hatched specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were orally infected with C. jejuni (NCTC 12744; 1 108 CFU/bird) at 14 days of age. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses at 14 days-post infection (dpi) revealed that the relative gene expression of the sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) and the peptide transporter (PepT-1) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in all investigated segments (duodenum, jejunum and cecum) of Campylobacter-infected birds, while the facilitated glucose transporter (GLUT-2) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in jejunal and cecal tissues only. Furthermore, down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT-2) and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-3) was seen in the jejunum, and down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the L-type amino acid transporter (y+ LAT-2) was noticed in the duodenum of infected birds. The decreased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters coincided with a decrease (P < 0.05) in body weight and body weight gain during a 2-week post infection period. For the first time, it can be concluded that nutrient transporter expression is compromised in the small and large intestine of Campylobacter-infected birds with negative consequences on growth performance.

The precise reasons for the symptomless chicken carriers are still unknown, but investigations of the gastrointestinal ecology of broiler chickens may improve our understanding of the microbial interactions with the host. Therefore, the current studies were conducted to investigate the effects of Campylobacter jejuni colonization on Escherichia coli translocation and on the metabolic end products (short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs). Following oral infection of 14 day old broiler chickens with 1 × 108 CFU of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 12744 in two independent animal trials, it was found that C. jejuni heavily colonized the intestine and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs. Moreover, in both animal trials, the findings revealed that C. jejuni promoted the translocation of E. coli with a higher number encountered in the spleen and liver at 14 days post infection (dpi). In addition, Campylobacter affected the microbial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract of broilers by reducing the amount of propionate, isovalerate, and isobutyrate in the cecal digesta of the infected birds at 2 dpi and, at 7 and 14 dpi, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate were also decreased. However, in the jejunum, the C. jejuni infection lowered only butyrate concentrations at 14 dpi. These data indicated that C. jejuni may utilize SCFAs as carbon sources to promote its colonization in the chicken gut, suggesting that Campylobacter cannot only alter gut colonization dynamics but might also influence physiological processes due to altered microbial metabolite profiles. Finally, the results demonstrated that C. jejuni can cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and facilitates the translocation of Campylobacter itself as well as of other enteric microorganisms such as E. coli to extraintestinal organs of infected birds. Altogether, our findings suggest that the Campylobacter carrier state in chicken is characterised by multiple changes in the intestinal barrier function, which supports multiplication and survival within the host.",

      "abstract": "Despite the importance of gut microbiota for broiler performance and health little is known about the composition of this ecosystem, its development and response towards bacterial infections. Therefore, the current study was conducted to address the composition and structure of the microbial community in broiler chickens in a longitudinal study from day 1 to day 28 of age in the gut content and on the mucosa. Additionally, the consequences of a Campylobacter (C.) jejuni infection on the microbial community were assessed. The composition of the gut microbiota was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene targeted Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Sequencing of 130 samples yielded 51,825,306 quality-controlled sequences, which clustered into 8285 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 0.03 distance level) representing 24 phyla. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes were the main components of the gut microbiota, with Proteobacteria and Firmicutes being the most abundant phyla (between 95.0 and 99.7% of all sequences) at all gut sites. Microbial communities changed in an age-dependent manner. Whereas, young birds had more Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes dominated in older birds (>14 days old). In addition, 28 day old birds had more diverse bacterial communities than young birds. Furthermore, numerous significant differences in microbial profiles between the mucosa and luminal content of the small and large intestine were detected, with some species being strongly associated with the mucosa whereas others remained within the luminal content of the gut. Following oral infection of 14 day old broiler chickens with 1 × 108 CFU of C. jejuni NCTC 12744, it was found that C. jejuni heavily colonized throughout the small and large intestine. Moreover, C. jejuni colonization was associated with an alteration of the gut microbiota with infected birds having a significantly lower abundance of Escherichia (E.) coli at different gut sites. On the contrary, the level of Clostridium spp. was higher in infected birds compared with birds from the negative controls. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrate how the bacterial microbiome composition changed within the early life of broiler chickens in the gut lumen and on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, our findings confirmed that the Campylobacter carrier state in chicken is characterized by multiple changes in the intestinal ecology within the host.",

Thus, we investigated whether chronic Campylobacter carriage affects chicken intestinal functions despite the absence of clinical symptoms. An experiment was carried out in which commercial chickens were orally infected with C. jejuni (1 108 CFU/bird) at 14 days of life. Changes in ion transport and barrier function were assessed by short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial ion conductance (Gt) in Ussing chambers. Gt increased in cecum and colon of Campylobacter-infected chicken 7 d post-infection (DPI), whereas Gt initially decreased in the jejunum at 7 DPI and increased thereafter at 14 DPI. The net charge transfer across the epithelium was reduced or tended to be reduced in all segments, as evidenced by a decreased Isc. Furthermore, the infection induced intestinal histomorphological changes, most prominently including a decrease in villus height, crypt depth and villus surface area in the jejunum at 7 DPI. Furthermore, body mass gain was decreased by Campylobacter carriage. This study demonstrates, for the first time, changes in the intestinal barrier function in Campylobacter-infected chickens and these changes were associated with a decrease in growth performance in otherwise healthy-appearing birds.",

      "abstract": "Although a high number of chickens carry Campylobacter jejuni, the mechanistic action of colonization in the intestine is still poorly understood. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the effects of C. jejuni on glucose uptake, amino acids availability in digesta, and intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i signaling in the intestines of broiler chickens. For this, we compared: control birds (n= 60) and C. jejuni-infected birds (n=60; infected orally with 1×108 CFU of C. jejuni NCTC 12744 at 14 days of age). Our results showed that glucose uptake was reduced due to C. jejuni infection in isolated jejunal, but not in cecal mucosa at 14 days postinfection (dpi). The decrease in intestinal glucose absorption coincided with a decrease in body weight gain during the 2-week post-infectious period. A reduction in the amount of the amino acids (serine, proline, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, arginine, histidine, and lysine) in ileal digesta of the infected birds at 2 and/or 7 dpi was found, indicating that Campylobacter utilizes amino acids as a carbon source for their multiplication. Applying the cell-permeable Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 and two-photon microscopy, we revealed that [Ca2+]i was increased in the jejunal and cecal mucosa of infected birds. The muscarinic agonist carbachol induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in jejunum and cecum mucosa of control chickens, a response absent in the mucosa of infected chickens, demonstrating that the modulation of [Ca2+]i by Campylobacter might be involved in facilitating the necessary cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the multifaceted interactions of C. jejuni with the gastrointestinal mucosa of broiler chickens. For the first time, it could be shown that a Campylobacterinfection could interfere with intracellular Ca2+ signaling and nutrient absorption in the small intestine with consequences on intestinal function, performance, and Campylobacter colonization. Altogether, these findings indicate that Campylobacter is not entirely a commensal and can be recognized as an important factor contributing to an impaired chicken gut health.",

Thirty ceca were collected at slaughter from batches of broilers from 789 flocks, at either full or partial depopulation, between December 2003 and March 2006 and examined individually for Campylobacter by direct plating onto selective media. Management and health data were collected from each flock and included information on mortality or culling during rearing, the number of birds rejected for infectious or noninfectious causes at slaughter, the proportion of birds with digital dermatitis (also termed hock burn), and other general characteristics of the flock. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 280 (35%) flocks. The relationship between bird health and welfare and Campylobacter status of flocks was assessed using random-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for region, month, year, and rearing regime. Campylobacter-positive batches of ceca were associated with higher levels of rejection due to infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI95%], 0.98 to 2.30) and digital dermatitis (OR, 2.08; CI95%, 1.20 to 3.61). Furthermore, higher levels of these conditions were also associated with the highest-level category of withinflock Campylobacter prevalence (70 to 100%).

Recent evidence suggests that the minimum infective oral dose for 100% caecal colonization is about 104 cfu, which, with such a 'fragile' organism, may limit transmissibility. However, the colonization potential of laboratory-adapted strains may be anomalous compared with fresh isolates or those passaged in vivo. The colonization potential of two chicken and one human C. jejuni isolates, which were minimally passaged, have been investigated using a quantitative model of chicken colonization. There was no detectable difference between these strains but all were more efficient colonizers than a laboratory-adapted strain 81116. In addition, the colonization potential of C. jejuni strain 81116 following a passage in vivo was also determined. The results indicated this increased c. 10000 fold following a single passage in vivo, such that a dose of only 40 cfu caused maximal colonization. Enhanced colonization potential may, therefore, account for the rapid rate of transmission within large flocks.",

      "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract represents the first barrier against pathogens. However, the interaction of Campylobacter with intestinal epithelial cells and its effects on the intestinal function of chickens are poorly studied. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of C. jejuni oral infection on the mRNA expression of nutrient transporters in the intestine. Newly hatched specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were orally infected with C. jejuni (NCTC 12744; 1 108 CFU/bird) at 14 days of age. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses at 14 days-post infection (dpi) revealed that the relative gene expression of the sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) and the peptide transporter (PepT-1) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in all investigated segments (duodenum, jejunum and cecum) of Campylobacter-infected birds, while the facilitated glucose transporter (GLUT-2) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in jejunal and cecal tissues only. Furthermore, down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT-2) and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-3) was seen in the jejunum, and down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the L-type amino acid transporter (y+ LAT-2) was noticed in the duodenum of infected birds. The decreased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters coincided with a decrease (P < 0.05) in body weight and body weight gain during a 2-week post infection period. For the first time, it can be concluded that nutrient transporter expression is compromised in the small and large intestine of Campylobacter-infected birds with negative consequences on growth performance. Furthermore, the down-regulation of mRNA expression of glucose and amino acid transporters may result in accumulation of nutrients in the intestinal lumen, which may favor C. jejuni replication and colonization.",

At the plant, defeathering, evisceration, and carcass chillers have been documented to cross-contaminate poultry carcasses. Carcass washings and the application of processing aids have been shown to reduce populations of Campylobacter in the carcasses by log10 0.5 to log10 1.5; however, populations of Campylobacter have been shown to enter a poultry processing plant at levels between log10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and log10 8 CFU/mL of carcass rinse.

      "abstract": "Optimal gut health is of vital importance to the performance of production animals. Gut health is synonymous in animal production industries with animal health. Although there does appear to be a direct relationship between animal performance and a “healthy” gastrointestinal tract (GIT), there is no clear definition for “gut health” that encompasses a number of physiological and functional features, including nutrient digestion and absorption, host metabolism and energy generation, a stable microbiome, mucus layer development, barrier function, and mucosal immune responses (1–8). The GIT is responsible for regulating physiological homeostasis that provides the host the ability to withstand infectious and non-infectious stressors (9–19). Understanding the interactions between these diverse physiological features emphasizes the extent of areas encompassed by gut health and the ability to regulate animal production. For our part, we will define gut health as the absence/prevention/avoidance of disease so that the animal is able to perform its physiological functions in order to withstand exogenous and endogenous stressors. Furthermore, worldwide public concerns about the production animal industries’ dependency on the use of growth-promoting antibiotics (AGPs) have resulted in the ban of AGPs by the European Union and a reassessment of their use in the United States. Thus, current research is focused on alternatives to antibiotics for sustainable food animal production (20).",

      "abstract": "The digestive system of a chicken is simple, short, and extremely efficient. In the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or foregut, in particular when feed is not continuously available, moistening of feed occurs in the crop followed by chemical and physical digestion in the proventriculus and gizzard, respectively, as a preparation for nutrient absorption which occurs in the distal portions of the GIT—duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and to a lower extent in the ceca and colon. Broiler husbandry practices in the past have focused on achieving high intakes of readily digestible nutrients and largely failed to consider the ancestral purpose of the foregut. Besides holding important digestive functions, the rich bacterial communities in both the crop and the gizzard transform these organs in barriers preventing the invasion of the GIT by pathogens. However, the amount of time feed spends in the foregut—and therefore the environment in this gut segment—is extremely variable and can be manipulated by different feeding practices, such as feed structure and composition, frequency of feeding, and/or light regimes. With further progress in terms of performance and health of broiler chickens being sought, and following decades of research focusing on distal GIT segments, it is about time to explore how the foregut can contribute to achieve these goals. This review revisits morphological, physiological, and microbiological characteristics of the foregut; explores the importance of this GIT portion as feed intake regulator; and discusses how husbandry and feeding practices such as lighting regimes and feed structure may be adapted to activate the crop and the gizzard, which results in performance and health improvements. Finally, interactions of these feeding practices with exogenous enzymes are discussed and suggestions for further research are made.",

However, the sequence of chicken FOXO3 is still incomplete and the cellular functions of FOXO3 in chickens are poorly understood. Thus, we obtained the full-length sequence of chicken FOXO3 by 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5 RACE) and the phylogenetic tree showed that the chicken FOXO3 sequence was homologous with those in other species. Flow cytometry analysis and 5-ethynyl2 -deoxyuridine assays showed that FOXO3 repressed cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH). Mutations were screened in the second exon of FOXO3 and 13 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the test population. Further analysis showed that rs317670452 and rs15379317 were associated with many growth and carcass traits, such as the body weight at different ages and breast muscle weight.

Two-hundred seventy 1-day-old broilers were weighed and randomly assigned to nine different treatments containing MSs.

MS7 (56 days, 5%) reduced Clostridia 4.8-fold and 3-fold in the stomach and bursa, respectively. The chicken stomach contained far more diverse bacteria than the bursa.

Graft versus host responses and the key role of lymphocytes in adaptive immunity were first described in work with chicken embryos and chickens. 2. Most notably, the bursa of Fabricius provided the first substantive evidence that there are two major lineages of lymphocytes. Bursal-derived lymphocytes, or B cells, make antibodies while thymus-derived, or T cells, are involved in cell-mediated immune responses. 3. Gene conversion, the mechanism used by the chicken to produce its antibody repertoire, was first described in the chicken and requires the unique environment of the bursa. Subsequently it has been shown that some mammals also use gene conversion. 4. The chicken’s Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), the first non-mammalian MHC to be sequenced, is minimal, compact and some 20-fold smaller than that of mammals. Uniquely, the chicken MHC is strongly associated with resistance to infectious diseases. 5. The first attenuated vaccine was developed by Louis Pasteur against a chicken pathogen, fowl cholera, and the first vaccine against a natural occurring cancer agent, Marek’s disease virus, was developed for the chicken. 6. Vaccination of chick embryos on the 18th d of incubation, another breakthrough using chickens, provides protection early after hatching. In ovo vaccination now is widely practised by the poultry industry. 7. Evidence that widespread and intensive vaccination can lead to increased virulence with some pathogens, such as Marek’s disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus, was first described with chicken populations. It warns of the need to develop more sustainable vaccination strategies in future and provides useful lessons for other species, including in the human population. 8. Recombinant DNA technologies now provide the opportunity for the rational design of new vaccines. Such vaccines could contain the protective immunogenic elements from several pathogens and immunomodulatory molecules to direct and enhance immune responses so providing improved protection. The important thing will be to design vaccines that are sustainable and do not drive pathogens to ever-increasing virulence.",

      "abstract": "Background: Since domestication, chickens did not only disperse into the different parts of the world but they have also undergone significant genomic changes in this process. Many breeds, strains or lines have been formed and those represent the diversity of the species. However, other than the natural evolutionary forces, management practices (including those that threaten the persistence of genetic diversity) following domestication have shaped the genetic make-up of and diversity between today’s chicken breeds. As part of the SYNBREED project, samples from a wide variety of chicken populations have been collected across the globe and were genotyped with a high density SNP array. The panel consists of the wild type, commercial layers and broilers, indigenous village/local type and fancy chicken breeds. The SYNBREED chicken diversity panel (SCDP) is made available to serve as a public basis to study the genetic structure of chicken diversity. In the current study we analyzed the genetic diversity between and within the populations in the SCDP, which is important for making informed decisions for effective management of farm animal genetic resources. Results: Many of the fancy breeds cover a wide spectrum and clustered with other breeds of similar supposed origin as shown by the phylogenetic tree and principal component analysis. However, the fancy breeds as well as the highly selected commercial layer lines have reduced genetic diversity within the population, with the average observed heterozygosity estimates lower than 0.205 across their breeds’ categories and the average proportion of polymorphic loci lower than 0.680. We show that there is still a lot of genetic diversity preserved within the wild and less selected African, South American and some local Asian and European breeds with the average observed heterozygosity greater than 0.225 and the average proportion of polymorphic loci larger than 0.720 within their breeds’ categories. Conclusions: It is important that such highly diverse breeds are maintained for the sustainability and flexibility of future chicken breeding. This diversity panel provides opportunities for exploitation for further chicken molecular genetic studies. With the possibility to further expand, it constitutes a very useful community resource for chicken genetic diversity research.",

Three chicken breeds (Baier Yellow Chicken (BEC), Beijing You Chicken (BYC) and Langshan Chicken (LSC)) are currently in conservation programs in China. Changes in genetic diversity were measured by heterozygosity, genomic inbreeding coefficients, and autozygosity, using estimates derived from runs of homozygosity (ROH) that were identified using SNPs. Results: Ninety DNA samples were collected from three generations for each breed. In the most recent generation, the highest genetic diversity was observed in LSC, followed by BEC and BYC. Inbreeding coefficients based on ROH for the three breeds declined slightly between the first and middle generations, and then rapidly increased. No inbreeding coefficients exceeded 0.1. Population structure assessments using neighbor-joining tree analysis, principal components analysis, and STRUCTURE analysis indicated that no genetic differentiation existed within breeds. LD decay and ROH at different cut-off lengths were used to identify traces left by recent or ancient inbreeding. Few long ROH were identified, indicating that inbreeding has been largely avoided with the current conservation strategy. The observed losses in genetic diversity and occurrences of inbreeding might be consequences of sub-optimal effective population sizes. Conclusions: The conserved Chinese chicken populations have high genomic diversity under the current conservation program (R: F). Furthermore, this study highlights the need to monitor dynamic changes in genetic diversity in conserved breeds over successive generations. Our research provides new insights into genetic diversity dynamics in conserved populations, and lays a solid foundation for improving conservation schemes.

Methods: We herein utilized histological section, genome-wide association study (GWAS) and RNA-seq, further to investigate the potential histological and molecular genetic mechanisms of white/red earlobe formation in Qiangyuan Partridge chicken (QYP). Results: through histological section analysis, we found the dermal papillary layer of red earlobes had many more blood vessels than that of white earlobes. And we identified a total of 44 SNPs from Chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20, 23 and Z, that was significantly associated with the chicken white/red earlobe color from GWAS, along with 73 significantly associated genes obtained (e.g., PIK3CB, B4GALT1 and TP63), supporting the fact that the white/red earlobe color was also polygenic and sex-linked in QYP. Importantly, PIK3CB and B4GALT1 are both involved in the biological process of angiogenesis, which may directly give rise to the chicken white earlobe formation through regulating blood vessel density in chicken earlobe. Additionally, through contrast of RNA-seq profiles between white earlobe skins and red earlobe skins, we further identified TP63 and CDH1 differentially expressed. Combined with the existing knowledge of TP63 in epithelial development and tumor angiogenesis, we propose that down-regulated TP63 in white earlobes may play roles in thickening the skin and decreasing the vessel numbers in dermal papillary layer, thereby contributing to the white earlobe formation via paling the redness of the skin in QYP, but the specific mechanism remains to be further clarified.

In order to identify unique gene expression patterns and link them to potential functions in the chicken liver, genes enriched in the liver of chickens needed to be investigated in a comparative manner. In this study, 41 liver-enriched genes were identified through chicken microarray, and many of them were validated through comparative analysis of mice and humans. Thirteen of them were unique in chickens, and their liver enhancement was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR. Furthermore, the expression of those 13 chicken liver-enriched genes was investigated, in response to nutritional and physiological challenges. Real-time PCR revealed that expression of PIT54 (P < 0.01), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) (P < 0.05), sulfotransferase (SULT) (P < 0.05), and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C, polypeptide 18 (CYP2C18) (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in the liver during fasting compared to ad libitum control. During the post-laying stage, expression of GAL8 was significantly increased (P < 0.01), but CYP2C18 expression was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Liver-enriched genes that were identified in this study and their expression patterns under fasting and the post-laying stage will serve as future targets to gain a better understanding of liver physiology, function and development in poultry.",

      "title": "A 100-Year Review: Protein and amino acid nutrition in dairy cows1",
      "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in understanding the protein and amino acid (AA) nutrition of dairy cows. The chemistry of feed crude protein (CP) appears to be well understood, as is the mechanism of ruminal protein degradation by rumen bacteria and protozoa. It has been shown that ammonia released from AA degradation in the rumen is used for bacterial protein formation and that urea can be a useful N supplement when lower protein diets are fed. It is now well documented that adequate rumen ammonia levels must be maintained for maximal synthesis of microbial protein and that a deficiency of rumen-degradable protein can decrease microbial protein synthesis, fiber digestibility, and feed intake. Rumen-synthesized microbial protein accounts for most of the CP flowing to the small intestine and is considered a high-quality protein for dairy cows because of apparent high digestibility and good AA composition. Much attention has been given to evaluating different methods to quantify ruminal protein degradation and escape and for measuring ruminal outflows of microbial protein and rumen-undegraded feed protein. The methods and accompanying results are used to determine the nutritional value of protein supplements and to develop nutritional models and evaluate their predictive ability. Lysine, methionine, and histidine have been identified most often as the most-limiting amino acids, with rumen-protected forms of lysine and methionine available for ration supplementation. Guidelines for protein feeding have evolved from simple feeding standards for dietary CP to more complex nutrition models that are designed to predict supplies and requirements for rumen ammonia and peptides and intestinally absorbable AA. The industry awaits more robust and mechanistic models for predicting supplies and requirements of rumen-available N and absorbed AA. Such models will be useful in allowing for feeding lower protein diets and increased efficiency of microbial protein synthesis.",

      "abstract": "This experiment was conducted with the objective to investigate the effects of slow-release urea and rumenprotected (RP) Met and His supplementation of a metabolizable protein (MP)-deficient diet (according to NRC, 2001) on lactation performance of dairy cows. Sixty lactating Holstein cows were used in a 10-wk randomized complete block-design trial. Cows were fed a covariate diet for 2 wk and then assigned to one of the following treatments for an 8-wk experimental period: (1) MP-adequate diet [AMP; 107% of MP requirements, based on the National Research Council (NRC, 2001)]; (2) MP-deficient diet (DMP; 95% of MP requirements); (3) DMP supplemented with slow-release urea (DMPU); (4) DMPU supplemented with RPMet (DMPUM); and (5) DMPUM supplemented with RPHis (DMPUMH). Total-tract apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein, and urinary N and urea-N excretions were decreased by DMP, compared with AMP. Addition of slow-release urea to the DMP diet increased urinary urea-N excretion. Dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield (on average 44.0 ± 0.9 kg/d) were not affected by treatments, except DMPUMH increased DMI and numerically increased milk yield, compared with DMPUM. Milk true protein concentration and yield were increased and milk fat concentration tended to be decreased by DMPUMH, compared with DMPUM. Cows gained less body weight on the DMP diet, compared with AMP. Plasma concentrations of His and Lys were not affected by treatments, whereas supplementation of RPMet increased plasma Met concentration. Plasma concentration of 3-methylhistidine was or tended to be higher for DMP compared with AMP and DMPU, respectively. Addition of RPHis to the DMPUM diet tended to increase plasma glucose and creatinine. In conclusion, feeding a 5% MP-deficient diet (according to NRC, 2001) did not decrease DMI and yields of milk and milk components, despite a reduction in nutrient digestibility. Supplementation of RPHis increased DMI and milk protein concentration and yield. These results are in line with our previous data and suggest that His may have a positive effect on voluntary feed intake and milk production and composition in high-yielding dairy cows fed MP-deficient diets.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare milk production and nutrient utilization in dairy cattle fed silage made from alfalfa (AL) or red clover (RC) versus birdsfoot trefoil (BFT) selected for low, normal, and high levels of condensed tannins. Condensed tannin contents of the 3 BFT silages were 8, 12, and 16 g/kg of DM by butanol-HCl assay. Twenty-five multiparous Holstein cows (5 fitted with ruminal cannulas) were blocked by days in milk and randomly assigned within blocks to incomplete 5 × 5 Latin squares. Diets contained [dry matter (DM) basis] about 60% AL, 50% RC, or 60% of 1 of the 3 BFT; the balance of dietary DM was largely from high-moisture corn plus supplemental crude protein from soybean meal. Diets were balanced to approximately 17% crude protein and fed for four 3-wk periods; 2 wk were allowed for adaptation and production data were collected during the last week of each period. No differences existed in DM intake or milk composition due to silage source, except that milk protein content was lowest for RC. Yields of milk, energy-corrected milk, fat, protein, lactose, and solids-not-fat were greater for the 3 BFT diets than for diets containing AL or RC. Feeding BFT with the highest condensed tannin content increased yield of milk, protein, and solids-not-fat compared with BFT containing the lowest amount of condensed tannin. Moreover, milk-N/N-intake was higher, and milk urea nitrogen concentration and urinary urea-N excretion were lower for diets with normal levels of BFT than for AL or RC diets. Feeding RC resulted in the highest apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and hemicellulose and lowest ruminal concentrations of ammonia and free amino acids. Ruminal branched-chain volatile fatty acid levels were lowest for RC diets and diets with high levels of BFT and highest for the AL diet. Overall, diets containing BFT silage supported greater production than diets containing silage from AL or RC. The results indicated that feeding BFT or other legume silages containing condensed tannins can enhance performance and N utilization in lactating dairy cows.",

For this purpose, 6 multiparous Holstein cows fistulated in the rumen and duodenum that averaged 73 d in milk were used in a 6 × 6 Latin square design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Two sources of CP [solventextracted soybean meal (SBM) and a mixture of SBM and a blend of animal-marine protein supplements plus ruminally protected Met (AMB)] and 3 levels of dietary protein (about 14, 16, and 18%) were combined into 6 treatments. On a dry matter (DM) basis, diets contained 25% corn silage, 20% alfalfa silage, 10% cottonseed, 26.7 to 37% corn grain, and 4 to 13.5% protein supplement. Intakes and digestibilities in the rumen and total tract of DM, organic matter, acid and neutral detergent fiber were unaffected by treatments. Increasing dietary CP from 14 to 18% decreased the intake and apparent ruminal and total tract digestion of starch, but increased the proportion of starch consumed by the cows that was apparently digested in the small intestine. At 14% CP, starch intake and total tract digestion were higher for the AMB diet than for the SBM diet, but the opposite occurred at 16% CP.

Following a 2-wk covariate period, cows were blocked by DIM and milk yield and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets, based on corn silage and alfalfa haylage: control, MP-adequate diet (ADMP; MP balance: +9 g/d); MPdeficient diet (DMP; MP balance: −317 g/d); DMP supplemented with RPLys (AminoShure-L, Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY) and RPMet (Mepron; Evonik Industries AG, Hanau, Germany; DMPLM); and DMPLM supplemented with an experimental RPHis preparation (DMPLMH). The analyzed crude protein content of the ADMP and DMP diets was 15.7 and 13.5 to 13.6%, respectively. The apparent totaltract digestibility of all measured nutrients, plasma urea-N, and urinary N excretion were decreased by the DMP diets compared with ADMP. Milk N secretion as a proportion of N intake was greater for the DMP diets compared with ADMP. Compared with ADMP, dry matter intake (DMI) tended to be lower for DMP, but was similar for DMPLM and DMPLMH (24.5, 23.0, 23.7, and 24.3 kg/d, respectively). Milk yield was decreased by DMP (35.2 kg/d), but was similar to ADMP (38.8 kg/d) for DMPLM and DMPLMH (36.9 and 38.5 kg/d, respectively), paralleling the trend in DMI. The National Research Council 2001 model underpredicted milk yield of the DMP cows by an average (±SE) of 10.3 ± 0.75 kg/d. Milk fat and true protein content did not differ among treatments, but milk protein yield was increased by DMPLM and DMPLMH compared with DMP and was not different from ADMP. Plasma essential amino acids (AA), Lys, and His were lower for DMP compared with ADMP. Supplementation of the DMP diets with RP AA increased plasma Lys, Met, and His. In conclusion, MP deficiency, approximately 15% below the National Research Council requirements from 2001, decreased DMI and milk yield in dairy cows. Supplementation of the MP-deficient diet with RPLys and RPMet diminished the difference in DMI and milk yield compared with ADMP and additional supplementation with RPHis eliminated it. As total-tract fiber digestibility was decreased with the DMP diets, but DMI tended to increase with RP AA supplementation, we propose that, similar to monogastric species, AA play a role in DMI regulation in dairy cows. Our data implicate His as a limiting AA in high-producing dairy cows fed corn silage- and alfalfa haylage-based diets, deficient in MP. The MP-deficient diets clearly increased milk N efficiency and decreased dramatically urinary N losses.",

Dry matter concentration, pH, and concentration of total N, soluble nonprotein N (SNPN), free amino acid N, and ammonia N of fresh and ensiled herbage were within the range of previous literature reports for forage legumes. The proportionf total N in the form of SNPN after 35 d ensiliag ranged from 32 to 73% in 1987 and 26 to 69% in 1988 and was negatively related to tannin concentration (r~ = 0.75).

      "abstract": "In current dairy production systems, an average of 25% of dietary N is captured in milk, with the remainder being excreted in urine and feces. About 60% of total N losses occur postabsorption. Splanchnic tissues extract a fixed proportion of total inflow of each essential AA (EAA). Those EAA removed by splanchnic tissues and not incorporated into protein are subjected to catabolism, with the resulting N converted to urea. Splanchnic affinity varies among individual EAA, from several fold lower than mammary glands’ affinity for the branchedchain AA to similar or higher affinity for Phe, Met, His, and Arg. On average, 85% of absorbed EAA appear in peripheral circulation, indicating that first-pass removal is not the main source of loss. Essential AA in excess of the needs of the mammary glands return to general circulation. High splanchnic blood flow dictates that a large proportion of EAA that return to general circulation flow through splanchnic tissues. In association with this constant recycling, EAA are removed and catabolized by splanchnic tissues. This results in splanchnic catabolism equaling or surpassing the use of many EAA for milk protein synthesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that EAA, energy substrates, and hormones activate signaling pathways that in turn regulate local blood flow, tissue extraction of EAA, and rates of milk protein synthesis. These recent findings would allow manipulation of dairy diets to maximize mammary uptake of EAA and reduce catabolism by splanchnic tissues. Dairy cattle nutrient requirement systems consider EAA requirements in aggregate as metabolizable protein (MP) and assume a fixed efficiency of MP use for milk protein. Lysine and Met sufficiency is only considered after MP requirements have been met. By idng so, requirement systems limit the scope of diet manipulation to achieve improved gross N efficiency. Therefore, this review focuses on understanding the dynamics of EAA metabolism in mammary and splanchnic tissues that would lead to improved requirement prediction systems. Inclusion of variable individual EAA efficiencies derived from splanchnic and mammary responses to nutrient and hormonal signals should help reduce dietary protein levels. Supplementing reduced crude protein diets with individual EAA should increase gross N efficiency to more than 30%, reducing N excretion by the US dairy industry by 92,000 t annually",

      "abstract": "Literature with data from dairy cows on pasture was reviewed to evaluate the effects of supplementation on intake, milk production and composition, and ruminal and postruminal digestion. Low dry matter intake (DMI) of pasture has been identified as a major factor limiting milk production by high producing dairy cows. Pasture DMI in grazing cows is a function of grazing time, biting rate, and bite mass. Concentrate supplementation did not affect biting rate (58 bites/min) or bite mass (0.47 g of DM/bite) but reduced grazing time 12 min/d per kilogram of concentrate compared with unsupplemented cows (574 min/d). Substitution rate, or the reduction in pasture DMI per kilogram of concentrate, is a factor which may explain the variation in milk response to supplementation. A negative relationship exists between substitution rate and milk response; the lower the substitution rate the higher the milk response to supplements. Milk production increases linearly as the amount of concentrate increases from 1.2 to 10 kg DM/d, with an overall milk response of 1 kg milk/kg concentrate. Compared with pasture-only diets, increasing the amount of concentrate supplementation up to 10 kg DM/d increased total DMI 24%, milk production 22%, and milk protein percentage 4%, but reduced milk fat percentage 6%. Compared with dry ground corn, supplementation with nonforage fiber sources or processed corn did not affect total DMI, milk production, or milk composition. Replacing ruminal degradable protein sources with ruminal undegradable protein sources in concentrates did not consistently affect milk production or composition.

      "abstract": "Profitable livestock production from forages largely depends on efficiency of converting forages into products. Efficient grazing management systems require an understanding of the roles of system components. However, experimentation should be conducted with regard to the system as a whole rather than on the systems components in isolation. This may necessitate development of computer models. The short-term intake of forage by grazing animals is controlled both by the structure of the forage and by effects of the ingested forage on gut fill as moderated by the hunger-satiety complex. Intake can be defined as the product of bite size, rate of biting and grazing time. Measurement of these variables is facilitated by the use of esophageally fistulated animals and automatic recording devices. Bite size has the greatest influence on intake, with rate of biting and grazing time being compensatory variables. Sward structure influences bite size to varying degrees. In temperate grass swards, leaf surface height appears to be the dominant influence on bite size. But in tropical grass swards, leaf density and leaf:stem ratio have a greater influence on bite size than does leaf surface height. Alternative techniques to conventional grazing trials are described. Diversity of environments and forages in the U.S. requires further research into the development of grazing systems.

      "abstract": "Milk production and composition were measured for 63 days in 153 Holstein–Friesian cows offered either 7, 10 or 13 kg/day (as fed) of a rolled, 74% barley/26% lupin grain mixture together with either no feed additive, 300 mg/day of virginiamycin (VM) or 300 mg/day of virginiamycin plus 200 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (VM + NaHCO3). All cows were fed 1 kg/day of a pelleted mineral supplement containing the additives. The cows were grazed as a single herd on perennial ryegrass–subterranean clover pasture with pasture silage available during periods of pasture shortage. Rumen fluid was analysed for pH and volatile fatty acids, blood for plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, urea and D- and L-lactic acid, faeces for dry matter and pH, and both urine and milk for urea and sodium. The incidence of grain bloat in all treatments was low. There was no main effect of dietary additive treatment on grain intake, but at the highest grain level, cows offered VM or VM + NaHCO3 ate more grain than those offered no dietary additive. There were no significant differences between the dietary additive treatments in milk production, milk composition, cell count, liveweight and condition score. Mean daily covariance-corrected yields of milk and protein (kg), and milk protein content (g/kg) respectively, were significantly (P<0.01) greater for cows fed 11 (28.0, 0.86, 30.6) and 14 kg/day (28.7, 0.88, 31.0) of concentrate compared with those fed 8 kg/day (26.4, 0.78, 29.7). Mean milk fat content (g/kg) was significantly (P<0.01) lower in milk from cows fed 14 kg/day (32.0) of concentrate compared with those fed 8 (35.9) or 11 (34.7) kg/day. There were no significant differences between concentrate feeding levels in milk fat yield or milk somatic cell count. Covariance-corrected liveweight and condition score were significantly (P<0.01) higher for cows fed 14 kg/day of concentrate compared with cows fed at the lower concentrate levels. There were no significant interactions between concentrate level and dietary additive for all milk production parameters. No significant differences were recorded between the different levels of concentrate in the concentration of total rumen volatile fatty acids, or in blood plasma concentrations of glucose and L-lactate. The rumen molar proportions of acetate and butyrate were significantly (P<0.01) lower, and propionate and valerate significantly (P<0.01) higher at the higher levels of concentrate offered. The molar ratio of acetate plus butyrate to propionate was significantly (P<0.01) higher in cows fed 8 kg/day of concentrate compared with cows fed 11 and 14 kg/day.

      "abstract": "An experiment was undertaken to establish the marginal milk production response from cereal grain supplementation by dairy cows grazing irrigated perennial pastures in spring and whether the addition of a hay supplement would improve that response. Cows were offered perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)–white clover (Trifolium repensL.) pasture at allowances (measured to ground level) of 20 or 40 kg dry matter (DM)/cow.day. Additional cows offered the low allowance were also offered supplements of pasture hay as a cube or pellet (2.5 kg DM/day), cereal grain as a pellet (5.0 kg DM/day) or cereal grain plus pasture hay (7.5 kg DM/day) as a pellet (1.75:1 DM basis) or cube (1.97:1 DM basis). The 7 treatments were replicated 3 times, and 63 cows were used (3 cows/treatment).\nThe in vitro DM digestibility, crude protein and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) concentration of the barley and perennial pasture hay were 863 and 563 g/kg DM, 131 and 92 g/kg DM, and 182 and 666 g/kg DM, respectively. Cows from all treatments consumed herbage with an in vitro DM digestibility of 833 g/kg DM, crude protein content of 214 g/kg DM and NDF concentration of 457 g/kg DM compared with the pregrazed herbage on offer of 771, 174 and 527 g/kg DM, respectively. The mean pregrazing herbage mass of 4.13 t DM/ha consisted of perennial ryegrass (507 g/kg DM), white clover (188 g/kg DM), weeds (194 g/kg DM) and dead material (111 g/kg DM).\n\nWithout supplements, cows consumed 11.2 kg DM/day at the low pasture allowance and 15.6 kg DM/day at the high allowance. Herbage intake did not decline to a large degree when barley was included in the diet, where a substitution rate of 0.2 kg reduction in pasture DM/kg DM cereal grain supplement was measured. The NDF concentration of the diet consumed was lowest (P< 0.05) for the grain pellet treatment (370 g NDF/kg DM) and highest (P<0.05) for the fibre pellet (493 g NDF/kg DM) and the fibre cube (507 g NDF/kg DM) treatments. Fat-corrected milk yield increased (P<0.05)) from 20.1 to 24.5 kg/cow.day when cows consumed 4.5 kg DM cereal grain/day with a marginal milk response of 1.0 kg 4% fat-corrected milk/kg DM concentrate supplement. Supplementation with grain or hay had no significant effect (P>0.05) on milk fat, protein or lactose concentrations. The cows offered the high allowance spent more (P<0.05) time grazing than those offered the low allowance, but there were no significant differences in rumination time. Cows spent more time ruminating when consuming the grain + fibre cube compared with the other supplement treatments, which were lower (P<0.05) and similar. Cows offered pasture at the low allowance ruminated the least. The rumen pH was not different between treatments and averaged 5.9. The ratio of acetate plus butyrate: propionate was not different between treatments and averaged 4.3.\n\nThis study has shown that feeding cereal grain to cows grazing pastures high in perennial ryegrass resulted in acceptable marginal milk responses of 1 kg milk/kg DM of cereal grain in spring because of sufficient NDF in the diet. As there was adequate NDF in the diet, further supplements with pasture hay as cubes or pellets had no effect on marginal milk responses ",

      "abstract": "Two grazing experiments tested the hypothesis that a cereal grain-based supplement, fed to cows that are in mid–late lactation and grazing low metabolisable energy and high neutral detergent fibre content paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.)-type pastures, will increase milk yield, but that this response will diminish with successive increments of supplement. A further objective of this research was to investigate some of the factors, such as altered rumen fermentation pattern, that might vary the point at which diminishing returns start to occur. Cows grazed irrigated perennial pasture at an allowance of either 25 (experiment 1) or 31 (experiment 3) kg of dry matter (DM) per cow per day in late summer–early autumn (mid–late lactation) and were supplemented with cereal grain-based concentrates up to 11 and 7 kg DM/cow.day in experiments 1 and 3, respectively. In experiment 1, there were 3 replicates of 6 treatments (3 cows in each treatment group) that involved the feeding of either 0, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 kg DM/cow.day of supplement for 50 days. Experiment 3 was conducted over 35 days. There were 2 replicates of 4 treatments (4 cows per treatment group) that involved the feeding of either 0, 3, 5 or 7 kg DM/cow.day of supplement. A further experiment (experiment 2), associated with experiment 1, examined the effects of offering cereal grain-based concentrates up to 7 kg DM/cow.day to dairy cows consuming 10 kg DM/day of herbage with a high paspalum content on aspects of rumen fermentation. Incremental responses of 40 g/kg fat-corrected milk (FCM) to increasing concentrate intake diminished with increasing concentrate intake, with the level of supplementation at which diminishing returns occurred dependent on herbage allowance and, therefore, herbage intake. At a supplement intake of 3 kg DM/cow.day, the response in FCM was 1.1 kg/kg concentrate DM in both grazing experiments. There were no further increases in milk production with additional increments of concentrates in experiment 3 where the pasture allowance was highest. In experiment 1, where concentrates were offered to a level of 11 kg DM/cow.day, and the pasture allowance was lower, diminishing returns were not as pronounced as in experiment 3 until the highest levels of concentrate intake. Substitution of supplement for herbage was a major factor in causing the diminishing returns in both experiments, but especially in experiment 3, where pasture intakes were higher. Milk fat content was significantly (P<0.05) reduced (41.8 v. 32.5 g/kg) when concentrate intake increased from 9 to 10.4 kg supplement DM/cow.day in experiment 1. It was hypothesised that this reduction in milk fat content was probably due to the effects of subclinical rumen lactic acidosis. This hypothesis was supported by the trend to lower rumen pH for longer periods as supplement intake increased as well as a more variable milk yield at the highest level of supplement intake. We conclude that responses of FCM of 1.1 kg/kg DM cereal grain-based concentrates can be achieved when they are fed twice daily up to 3 kg DM/day to dairy cows grazing restricted amounts of paspalum-type pasture in autumn. Beyond 3 kg DM/day, marginal responses diminished with increasing concentrate intake, with the level of supplementation at which diminishing returns occurred being dependent on herbage allowance and, therefore, intake.",

We tested whether dietary CP content influenced relative effectiveness of equal supplemental CP from either CM or SBM. Fifty lactating Holstein cows were blocked by parity and days in milk into 10 squares (2 squares with ruminal cannulas) in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square trial. Five squares were fed: (1) low (14.5–14.8%) CP with SBM, (2) low CP with CM, (3) low CP with SBM plus CM, (4) high (16.4–16.7%) CP with SBM, and (5) high CP with CM; the other 5 squares were fed the same diets except with rumenprotected Met plus Lys (RPML) added as Mepron (Degussa Corp., Kennesaw, GA) and AminoShure-L (Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY), which were assumed to provide 8 g/d of absorbed dl-Met and 12 g/d of absorbed l-Lys. Diets contained [dry matter (DM) basis] 40% corn silage, 26% alfalfa silage, 14 to 23% corn grain, 2.4% mineral-vitamin premixes, and 29 to 33% neutral detergent fiber. Periods were 3 wk (total 15 wk), and data from the last week of each period were analyzed using the Mixed procedures of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The only effects of RPML were increased DM intake and milk urea N (MUN) and urinary N excretion and trends for decreased milk lactose and solids-not-fat concentrations and milk-N:N intake; no significant RPML × protein source interactions were detected. Higher dietary CP increased milk fat yield and tended to increase milk yield but also elevated MUN, urine volume, urinary N excretion, ruminal concentrations of ammonia and branched-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA), lowered milk lactose concentration and milk-N:N intake, and had no effect on milk true protein yield. Feeding CM instead of SBM increased feed intake, yields of milk, energy-corrected milk, and true protein, and milk-N:N intake, tended to increase fat and lactose yields, and reduced MUN, urine volume, and urinary N excretion. At low CP, MUN was lower and intake tended to be greater on SBM plus CM versus SBM alone, but MUN and N excretion were not reduced to the same degree as on CM alone. Interactions of parity × protein source and parity × CP concentration indicated that primiparous cows were more responsive than multiparous cows to improved supply of metabolizable protein. Replacing SBM with CM reduced ruminal ammonia and branched-chain VFA concentrations, indicating lower ruminal degradation of CM protein. Replacing SBM with CM improved milk and protein yield and N-utilization in lactating cows fed both low- and high-CP diets.",

Twelve lactating multiparous Holstein cows were randomly selected and blocked into 3 groups of 4 cows intended to represent early [123 ± 26 d in milk (DIM); mean ± standard deviation], mid (175 ± 3 DIM), and late (221 ± 12 DIM) lactation stages. Cows within each stage of lactation were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence within a split-plot Latin square balanced for carryover effects. Stage of lactation formed the main plots (squares) and dietary CP levels (15, 17, 19, and 21% of diet dry matter) formed the subplots. Graded amounts of urea were added to the basal total mixed ration to linearly increase dietary CP content while maintaining similar concentrations of all other nutrients among treatments. The experimental periods lasted 7 d, with d 1 to 6 used for adjustment to diets and d 7 used for total collection of urine as well as milk and blood sample collection. Dry matter intake and yields of milk, fat, protein, and lactose declined progressively with lactation stage and were unaffected by dietary CP content. Milk and plasma urea-N as well as UUN concentration and excretion increased in response to dietary CP content. Milk and urine urea-N concentration rose at increasing and decreasing rates, respectively, as a function of plasma urea-N. The renal urea-N clearance rate differed among lactation stages and dietary CP contents.

      "abstract": "Current trends in the global milk market and the recent abolition of milk quotas have accelerated the trend of the European dairy industry towards larger farm sizes and higher-yielding animals. Dairy cows remain in focus, but there is a growing interest in other dairy species, whose milk is often directed to traditional and protected designation of origin and gourmet dairy products. The challenge for dairy farms in general is to achieve the best possible standards of animal health and welfare, together with high lactational performance and minimal environmental impact. For larger farms, this may need to be done with a much lower ratio of husbandry staff to animals. Recent engineering advances and the decreasing cost of electronic technologies has allowed the development of ‘sensing solutions’ that automatically collect data, such as physiological parameters, production measures and behavioural traits. Such data can potentially help the decision making process, enabling early detection of health or wellbeing problems in individual animals and hence the application of appropriate corrective husbandry practices. This review focuses on new knowledge and emerging developments in welfare biomarkers (e.g. stress and metabolic diseases), activity-based welfare assessment (e.g. oestrus and lameness detection) and sensors of temperature and pH (e.g. calving alert and rumen function) and their combination and integration into ‘smart’ husbandry support systems that will ensure optimum wellbeing for dairy animals and thereby maximise farm profitability. Use of novel sensors combined with new technologies for information handling and communication are expected to produce dramatic changes in traditional dairy farming systems.",

Primary data was collected from smallholder dairy farms using survey questionnaires. A Cobb-Douglas production function and multiple regression models were estimated to analyze farm milk productivity and gross margin of the dairy farms. Surveyed dairy farms owned on an average 3.07 milking cows comprising 0.37 indigenous and 2.70 crossbred cows. Average milk productivity was 7.80 liter per cow per day, in which indigenous cow milk productivity was 1.9 1iter per day and crossbred cow milk productivity was 6.48 liter per cow per day. The study found that average daily milk production of small, medium, and large dairy farms were 5.45, 32.50, and 59.83 liter, respectively. Average monthly revenue and cost of milk production were US$ 79 and US$ 21 per cow, resulting in the average net return of US$ 58 per cow per month. Both quantitative estimation and t test results indicated a positive and statistically significant relationship between farm size and milk productivity and gross margin. The study findings also indicate that crossbred cows are providing higher economic benefits to the dairy farmers compared to the indigenous breeds.

      "abstract": "Organic farming is believed by many to be an environmentally friendly production system that promotes the use of local forage while strongly limiting the input of chemicals, including allopathic treatments. As organic dairy farming has grown, farmers have realised that many available conventional breeds of cow are not well adapted to the new situations and that more ‘robust’ cows, able to function well in the constraining organic environment, are needed to yield acceptable longevity and productivity. In this review paper, the current breed diversity in organic dairy farming is analysed with the aim of identifying the types of cow that would best fulfil organic breeding goals. Unlike the conventional sector, organic dairy farming is very heterogeneous and no single type of cow can adapt well to all scenarios. There are advantages and disadvantages to the use of existing breeds (rustic Holstein-Friesian, other rustic breeds and crosses), and strong genotype × environment interactions demand different strategies for very diverse situations. Organic dairy farms producing milk for systems that recompense milk volume would benefit from using higher milk yielding cows, and rustic Holstein-Friesian cows may be the best option in such cases. Although most Holstein-Friesian cows are currently selected for use in conventional systems, this situation could be reversed by the implementation of an organic merit index that includes organic breeding goals. Farms producing milk either for systems that recompense milk solids or for transformation into dairy products would benefit from using breeds other than Holstein-Friesian or their crosses. Organic farmers who focus on rural tourism, farm schools or other businesses in which marketing strategies must be taken into account could benefit from using local breeds (when possible) or other rustic breeds that are highly valued by consumers.",

In UL, markets were functional, with predominantly informal market chains, with a high milk price (US $ 45.1/100 kg). Inputs were available in UL markets, but prices were high for inputs such as concentrates, fodder, replacement stock and hired labour. Moreover, availability of grazing land and the high opportunity costs for family labour were limiting dairy activities. In UL, milk production per cow (6.9 kg/cow/day) and per farm (20.1 kg/farm/day) were relatively low, and we concluded that farm development was constrained by scarcity of inputs and production factors. In rural locations (MRL and ERL), markets were functional with relatively low prices (average US $ 32.8/100 kg) for milk in both formal and informal market chains. Here, concentrates were relatively cheap but also of low quality. Fodder, replacement stock and labour were more available in rural locations than in UL. In rural locations, milk production per cow (average 7.2 kg/cow/day) and per farm (average 18.5 kg/farm/day) were low, and we concluded that farm development was constrained by low quality of concentrates and low price of milk. In all locations, production for subsistence was valued since income generated was used for non-dairy expenses. A tailor-made package of interventions that targets the above constraints is recommended for farm development.",

      "abstract": "Dairy cow longevity combines all functional traits and is thought to be especially important in organic production, which is an established, increasing part of Swedish dairy production, representing approximately 6% of the market. The aim of this study was to compare dynamics in culling reasons between organic and conventional production and to analyze genotype by environment interactions for longevity. The data contained information from all organic herds with information available from official recording (n = 402) and from approximately half of the conventional herds (n = 5,335). Records from Swedish Holsteins (n = 155,379) and Swedish Red cows (n = 160,794) that had their first calf between January 1998 and September 2003 were included. The opportunity period for longevity was at least 6 yr. Six longevity traits were defined: length of productive life; survival through first, second, and third lactations; fertility-determined survival; and udder health-determined survival. Twenty codes were used to describe the cause of culling, and these were divided into 8 groups: udder health, low fertility, low production, leg problems, metabolic diseases, other diseases, other specified causes, and unspecified cause. The main reason for culling cows in organic herds was poor udder health, whereas for cows in conventional herds it was low fertility. Furthermore, the shift in main culling reason from fertility, which was most common in first lactation regardless of production system, to udder health occurred at a lower age in organic production. Heritabilities and genetic correlations for the longevity traits expressed in organic and conventional herds were estimated from a bivariate animal model. The genetic correlations were close to unity (>0.88), except for fertility-determined survival in the Swedish Red breed (0.80). Heritabilities were low to moderate, and no clear pattern was identified for production system or breed. In general, the results indicate that farmers’ culling criteria differ between organic and conventional production. Different preferences may influence the need for alternative selection indexes for organic production, with different weightings of traits, or a separate breeding program. However, no genotype by environment interaction of importance was found between the production systems.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-nine multiparous cows of each of the Jersey and Friesian breeds, all k-casein AB phenotype, were grazed together and managed identically. On three occasions during 10 d in spring (early lactation), milk was collected from all cows at four consecutive milkings and bulked according to breed. On a separate occasion, milk samples were also collected from each cow at consecutive a.m. and p.m. milkings to form one daily sample per cow. The bulked milks (800–1000 l per breed on each occasion) were standardized to a protein : fat (P : F) ratio of 0. 80, and 350 l from each breed was made into Cheddar cheese. The solids content of the remaining Friesian milk was then increased by ultrafiltration to a solids concentration equal to that of the Jersey milk. This solids-standardized Friesian milk and a replicate batch of P : F standardized Jersey milk were made into two further batches of Cheddar cheese in 350-l vats. Compared with Friesian milk, Jersey milk had higher concentrations of most milk components measured, including protein, casein and fat. There were few difference in milk protein composition between breeds, but there were differences in fat composition. Friesian milk fat had more conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) than Jersey milk fat. Jersey milk coagulated faster and formed firmer curd than Friesian milk. Concentrations of some milk components were correlated with coagulation parameters, but relationships did not allow prediction of cheesemaking potential. Jersey milk yielded 10% more cheese per kg than Friesian milk using P : F standardized milk, but for milks with the same solids concentration there were no differences in cheese yield. No differences in cheese composition between breeds were detected. Differences in cheesemaking properties of milk from Jerseys and Friesians were entirely related to the concentrations of solids in the original milk",

      "abstract": "New Zealand (NZ) dairy farms used to be the lowest input and most efficient dairy farms of the world. However, intensification of the traditional pasture-based system has occurred over the last decade and has not always been accompanied by increased efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to produce an updated reference of the eco-efficiency of NZ dairy farm systems and to analyse the implications of intensification on their eco-efficiency. Results for an average NZ dairy farm system were compared with those for three dairy farmlet systems representing a wide range in intensification practices. A low input system (LI) (no N fertiliser, no brought-in feed supplement, stocking rate of 2.3 cows/ha) was compared with an N-fertilised farm system (NF) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 3 cows/ha) representing a first level of intensification and with an N-fertilised and maize silage supplemented system (NFMS) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 13 t DM maize silage/ha/year, 5.2 cows/ha), representing a possible future intensification option. Their eco-efficiency in terms of milk production and land use was compared using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. NZ dairy farm systems rely on favourable temperate climate conditions and long-term perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture, to achieve eco-efficient milk production and land use compared to European systems. However, intensification of NZ dairy farms was shown to be detrimental to their eco-efficiency in terms both of milk production and land use functions and could greatly reduce their advantage compared to European systems. The ecoefficiency of LI was very high whatever the functional unit which is remarkable from an LCA perspective. NF and NFMS had a similar eco-efficiency except for energy use which corresponded to the most critical hot spot of NFMS. All studied NZ systems presented some areas for improvement where some new technologies available for dairy farms might play a promising role in the future. Finally, it should be highlighted that the comparison with European studies based on the literature available needs validation through a more comprehensive study using harmonised methodology and assumptions across countries.",

      "abstract": "To improve sustainability, farmers may want to redesign their livestock farming systems in depth. Systemic modelling has proved an efficient tool to study complex issues regarding farming systems, but it remains inefficient to support farmers in their system redesign processes. This paper describes and discusses a novel method to model livestock farming systems with groups of farmers to help them redesign their own systems. Modelling livestock farming systems at the farm scale with farmer groups is an original approach in livestock farming system modelling. Following a constructivist approach, our method involves working with farmers already involved in redesign processes and building causal maps according to their own representations, without using models previously created by scientists. Applying the method, we built two causal maps of livestock farming system operation, each one built with a group of five farmers including both those converting and converted to organic farming. Converting to organic farming was considered as one example of a redesign process. On the basis of a subjective assessment by both the participating farmers and researchers, and an analysis of map structures, we assessed the method’s strengths and weaknesses. We considered that one of its main advantages lay in its collective dimension: sharing, comparing and questioning interested the participating farmers greatly; however, it requires good facilitation skills and suitable group composition. Furthermore, the formalising process identified, for example, vicious circles in system operation, which made the farmers think about solutions for breaking them. Finally, analysis of map structures identified similarities and differences between the two groups that were discussed with both of them during a final workshop; this activity continued farmers’ self-reflection about their systems, which may help lead to innovative and more sustainable livestock farming systems.",

      "abstract": "During the last 20 yr, the percentage of Holstein Friesian (HF) cows in the New Zealand (NZ) herd with North American Holstein genetics has increased from 2 to 38%. The use of North American Holstein genetics was increased to broaden the genetic base of the HF population in NZ and to incorporate traits for high productivity. Analysis of the national database and several comparative studies have shown that, in general, North American-derived Holstein cows were heavier, produced more milk volume and protein yield, had lower concentrations of fat and protein, and had poorer fertility and survival than NZ HF cows. Failure to get in calf and maintain a 365-d calving interval appears to be one of the key reasons for the reduced survival of North American Holstein cows within a seasonal dairying system. Analysis of the productive, reproductive, and survival characteristics of North American Holstein and NZ HF cows revealed an average advantage of $NZ 4950 per farm per year in favor of NZ HF cows, which represented approximately a 12% difference in economic farm surplus. If the population of Holstein genetics outside New Zealand is to be used in NZ pastoral dairying systems, these results suggest that fertility traits should be included in the national breeding objectives.",

The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) was used to predict sensitivity of milk production to a 10 % change in the composition of pasture nutrients. The rate at which fibre and protein were degraded in the rumen and the value given to effective fibre and lignin content significantly affected the supply of metabolisable energy and protein, and the profile of amino acid supply. The first limiting factor in milk production when only high-quality pasture was fed was metabolisable energy supply, while specific amino acids, particularly methionine and lysine, limited milk production when > 20 g/kg diet consisted of a grain supplement. Compared with cows fed a total mixed ration in confinement, North American Holstein–Friesians grazing all pasture produced less milk (29·6 v. 44·1 kg/d). Of the difference in milk production 61 % could be attributed to a lower DM intake (19 kg/d v. 23·4 kg/d). Predictions using the CNCPS indicated that supply of metabolisable energy was the first-limiting factor for milk production from high-quality pasture (251 g crude protein (N × 6·25)/kg, 432 g neutraldetergent fibre/kg, 77 % in vitro DM digestibility), rather than metabolisable protein or amino acids. In addition, these nutritional limitations imposed by pasture diets will be greater for dairy cow genotypes that have not been selected for high performance within a pasture system.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the profitability of dairy herds under three mating systems involving the Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, and Ayrshire breeds. Mating systems were straight breeding and rotational crossbreeding using two or three breeds. A deterministic model was developed to simulate the nutritional, biological, and economic performance of dairy herds under New Zealand conditions. Expected performances per cow were obtained using estimates of breed group and heterosis effects, age effects, and age distribution in the herd. Requirements for dry matter in feed were estimated per cow for maintenance, lactation, pregnancy, and growth of the replacements. Stocking rate was calculated by assuming 12,000 kg of dry matter utilized annually per hectare. Productivity per hectare was calculated as performance per cow multiplied by stocking rate. Profitability was the difference between income (sale of milk and salvage value of animals) and costs (related to the number of cows in the herd and the land area farmed). Under current market values for milk and meat, all of the rotational crossbred herds showed superior profitability to the straightbred herds (Holstein-Friesian × Jersey, NZ$505/ha; HolsteinFriesian × Jersey × Ayrshire NZ$493/ha; Jersey × Ayrshire, NZ$466/ha; Holstein-Friesian × Ayrshire, NZ$430/ha; Jersey, NZ$430/ha; Holstein-Friesian, NZ$398/ha; and Ayrshire, NZ$338/ha). Changes in the value for fat relative to protein affected profitability more significantly in herds using the Jersey breed, and changes in the value for meat affected profitabiity more significantly in herds using the Holstein-Friesian and Ayrshire breeds. Results suggested that, under New Zealand conditions, the use of rotational crossbreeding systems could increase profitability of dairy herds under the conceivable market conditions.",

The goal of this study was to estimate heritabilities of milk production traits under organic farming conditions and to estimate the magnitude of G×E between organic and conventional dairy farming. For this purpose, production records of firstparity Holstein heifers were used. Heritabilities of milk, fat and protein yield, and somatic cell score (SCS) were higher under organic farming conditions. For percentages of fat and protein, heritabilities of organic and conventional production were very similar. Genetic correlations between preorganic and organic, and organic and conventional milk production were 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. For fat yield, these correlations were 0.86 and 0.88, and for protein yield, these were 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. Our findings indicate that moderate G×E was present for yield traits. For percentage of fat and protein and SCS, genetic correlations between organic and conventional and preorganic production were close to unity, indicating that there was no G×E for these traits.",

We performed a literature review to identify factors negatively affecting milk production in Malawi and propose potential solutions to overcome the particular constraints. We structured the analysis along the value chain with three major components: upstream providers, on-farm production, and downstream providers. It is shown that the literature strongly focuses on on-farm constraints and most prominently on animal health, breed choice, and milk yield. The literature research did not reveal any reasons specific to Malawi that would hinder an increase in milk production as experienced in neighboring countries. We suggest a focus on crossbreeds accompanied by local breeding programs, which would reduce dependence on imported semen and strengthen the currently unreliable artificial insemination services. In addition, crossbreeds may be better suited than pure breeds for current feeding practices and climate conditions and thus come close to reaching their genetic potential. We conclude that cost advantages of crossbreeds clearly compensate for the lower revenues compared with exotic breeds such as Holstein-Friesian or Jersey",

Temperature will increase in tropical and temperate zones, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and this will push growing seasons and dairy farming away from arid areas and into more northern latitudes. Dairy consumption will increase because it provides essential nutrients more efficiently than many other agricultural systems. Dairy farming will become modernized in developing countries and milk production per cow will increase, doubling in countries with advanced dairying systems. Profitability of dairy farms will be the key to their sustainability. Genetic improvements will include emphasis on the coding genome and associated noncoding epigenome of cattle, and on microbiomes of dairy cattle and farmsteads. Farm sizes will increase and there will be greater lateral integration of housing and management of dairy cattle of different ages and production stages. Integrated sensors, robotics, and automation will replace much of the manual labor on farms. Managing the epigenome and microbiome will become part of routine herd management. Innovations in dairy facilities will improve the health of cows and permit expression of natural behaviors. Herds will be viewed as superorganisms, and studies of herds as observational units will lead to improvements in productivity, health, and well-being of dairy cattle, and improve the agroecology and sustainability of dairy farms.

After thorough screening on relevance and classification by the authors, 142 papers remained for further analysis. The area of precision dairy farming (with classes in the primary chain (dairy farm, feed, breed, health, food, retail, consumer) and levels for object of interest (animal, farm, network)), the Big Data-V area (with categories on Volume, Velocity, Variety and other V’s) and the data analytics area (with categories in analysis methods (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised classification, reinforcement learning) and data characteristics (time-series, streaming, sequence, graph, spatial, multimedia)) were analysed. The animal sublevel, with 83% of the papers, exceeds the farm sublevel and network sublevel. Within the animal sublevel, topics within the dairy farm level prevailed with 58% over the health level (33%). Within the Big Data category, the Volume category was most favoured with 59% of the papers, followed by 37% of papers that included the Variety category.

Dairy sheep are concentrated around the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, where their dairy products are typical ingredients of the human diet. Dairy goats are concentrated in low-income, fooddeficit countries of the Indian subcontinent, where their products are a key food source, but are also present in high-income, technologically developed countries. This review evaluates the status of the dairy sheep and goat sectors in the world, with special focus on the commercially and technically developed industries in France, Greece, Italy, and Spain (FGIS). Dairy small ruminants account for a minor part of the total agricultural output in France, Italy, and Spain (0.9 to 1.8%) and a larger part in Greece (8.8%). In FGIS, the dairy sheep industry is based on local breeds and crossbreeds raised under semi-intensive and intensive systems and is concentrated in a few regions in these countries. Average flock size varies from small to medium (140 to 333 ewes/farm), and milk yield from low to medium (85 to 216 L/ewe), showing substantial room for improvement. Most sheep milk is sold to industries and processed into traditional cheese types, many of which are Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) cheeses for gourmet and export markets (e.g., Pecorino, Manchego, and Roquefort). By comparing break-even milk price among FGIS countries, we observed the following: (1) most Greek and French dairy sheep farms were unprofitable, with the exception of the intensive Chios farms of Greece; (2) milk price was aligned with cost of production in Italy; and (3) profitable farms coexisted with unprofitable farms in Spain. In FGIS, dairy goat production is based on local breeds raised under more extensive systems than sheep. Compared with sheep, average dairy goat herds are smaller (36 to 190 does/ farm) but milk yield is greater (153 to 589 L/doe), showing room for improvement. Goat milk is mainly processed on-farm into dairy products for national markets, but some PDO goat milk cheeses (e.g., Murcia al Vino) are exported. Processed goat milk is sold for local human consumption or dehydrated for export. Mixed sheep-goat (e.g., Feta) and cow-sheep-goat milk cheeses are common in many countries. Strategies to improve the dairy sheep and goat sectors in these 4 countries are proposed and discussed. Key words: milk, dairy",

Soybeans contain large amounts of isoflavones, such as the genistein and daidzain. Previously, it has been demonstrated that genistein, one of the predominant soy isoflavones, can inhibit several steps involved in carcinogenesis. It is suggested that genistein possesses pleiotropic molecular mechanisms of action including inhibition of tyrosine kinases, DNA topoisomerase II, 5α-reductase, galectin-induced G2/M arrest, protein histidine kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinases, modulation of different signaling pathways associated with the growth of cancer cells (e.g., NF-κB, Akt, MAPK), etc. Moreover, genistein is also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Uncontrolled angiogenesis is considered as a key step in cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis. Genistein was found to inhibit angiogenesis through regulation of multiple pathways, such as regulation of VEGF, MMPs, EGFR expressions and NF-κB, PI3-K/Akt, ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thereby causing strong antiangiogenic effects.

The role of soy isoflavones in cancer prevention and promotion is somewhat unclear. There are two views in terms of soy isoflavones and breast cancer. One line of evidence suggests that soy and its isoflavones have exhibited cancer-preventive properties including lengthening the menstrual cycle, altering estrogen metabolism away from cancerous compounds, and demonstrating anti-proliferative properties in vivo. On the contrary, isoflavones found in soy products are suggested to behave as weak estrogens and as such, much speculation surrounds the influence of soy and/or its isoflavones on hormone-receptor-positive cancers. The objective of this review is to present the latest knowledge regarding the role of soy and its isoflavones with the development and advancement of breast cancer, the safety of soy isoflavones for breast cancer survivors, and a comparison of the carcinogenic effects in animal models following soy isoflavone and estrogen administration. This review compares and contrasts literature in terms of the anti-cancer and cancer-promoting effects of soy isoflavones and estrogen in humans and animal models. In conclusion, current human and animal data provide evidence for several anticancer properties of soy and/or its isoflavones. Although the specific quantities and constituents responsible for the observed anti-cancer effects have not been elucidated, it appears that soy isoflavones do not function as an estrogen, but rather exhibit anti-estrogenic properties. However, their metabolism differs between humans and animals and therefore the outcomes of animal studies may not be applicable to humans. The majority of breast cancer cases are hormone-receptor-positive; therefore, soy isoflavones should be considered a potential anti-cancer therapeutic agent and warrant further investigation.",

The identification of isoflavones as possible chemopreventive agents helped fuel this line of investigation. These diphenolic compounds, which are found in uniquely-rich amounts in soy beans, possess both estrogen-dependent and -independent properties that potentially inhibit the development of breast cancer. Observational studies show that among Asian women higher soy consumption is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer. However, evidence suggests that for soy to reduce breast cancer risk consumption must occur early in life, that is during childhood and/or adolescence. Despite the interest in the role of soy in reducing breast cancer risk concerns have arisen that soy foods, because they contain isoflavones, may increase the likelihood of high-risk women developing breast cancer and worsen the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, extensive clinical and epidemiologic data show these concerns to be unfounded. Clinical trials consistently show that isoflavone intake does not adversely affect markers of breast cancer risk, including mammographic density and cell proliferation. Furthermore, prospective epidemiologic studies involving over 11,000 women from the USA and China show that postdiagnosis soy intake statistically significantly reduces recurrence and improves survival",

      "abstract": "The recent 70% decline in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon suggests that it is possible to manage the advance of a vast agricultural frontier. Enforcement of laws, interventions in soy and beef supply chains, restrictions on access to credit, and expansion of protected areas appear to have contributed to this decline, as did a decline in the demand for new deforestation. The supply chain interventions that fed into this deceleration are precariously dependent on corporate risk management, and public policies have relied excessively on punitive measures. Systems for delivering positive incentives for farmers to forgo deforestation have been designed but not fully implemented. Territorial approaches to deforestation have been effective and could consolidate progress in slowing deforestation while providing a framework for addressing other important dimensions of sustainable development.",

      "title": "Soy moratorium impacts on soybean and deforestation dynamics in Mato Grosso, Brazil",
      "abstract": "Previous research has established the usefulness of remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to characterize the spatial dynamics of agriculture in the state of Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil. With these data it has become possible to track MT agriculture, which accounts for ~85% of Brazilian Amazon soy production, across periods of several years. Annual land cover (LC) maps support investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of agriculture as they relate to forest cover and governance and policy efforts to lower deforestation rates. We use a unique, spatially extensive 9- year (2005–2013) ground reference dataset to classify, with approximately 80% accuracy, MODIS VI data, merging the results with carefully processed annual forest and sugarcane coverages developed by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research to produce LC maps for MT for the 2001–2014 crop years. We apply the maps to an evaluation of forest and agricultural intensification dynamics before and after the Soy Moratorium (SoyM), a governance effort enacted in July 2006 to halt deforestation for the purpose of soy production in the Brazilian Amazon. We find the pre-SoyM deforestation rate to be more than five times the postSoyM rate, while simultaneously observing the pre-SoyM forest-to-soy conversion rate to be more than twice the post-SoyM rate. These observations support the hypothesis that SoyM has played a role in reducing both deforestation and subsequent use for soy production. Additional analyses explore the land use tendencies of deforested areas and the conceptual framework of horizontal and vertical agricultural intensification, which distinguishes production increases attributable to cropland expansion into newly deforested areas as opposed to implementation of multi-cropping systems on existing cropland. During the 14-year study period, soy production was found to shift from predominantly single-crop systems to majority double-crop systems.",

      "title": "Decoupling of deforestation and soy production in the southern Amazon during the late 2000s",
      "abstract": "From 2006 to 2010, deforestation in the Amazon frontier state of Mato Grosso decreased to 30% of its historical average (1996– 2005) whereas agricultural production reached an all-time high. This study combines satellite data with government deforestation and production statistics to assess land-use transitions and potential market and policy drivers associated with these trends. In the forested region of the state, increased soy production from 2001 to 2005 was entirely due to cropland expansion into previously cleared pasture areas (74%) or forests (26%). From 2006 to 2010, 78% of production increases were due to expansion (22% to yield increases), with 91% on previously cleared land. Cropland expansion fell from 10 to 2% of deforestation between the two periods, with pasture expansion accounting for most remaining deforestation. Declining deforestation coincided with a collapse of commodity markets and implementation of policy measures to reduce deforestation. Soybean profitability has since increased to pre2006 levels whereas deforestation continued to decline, suggesting that antideforestation measures may have influenced the agricultural sector. We found little evidence of direct leakage of soy expansion into cerrado in Mato Grosso during the late 2000s, although indirect land-use changes and leakage to more distant regions are possible. This study provides evidence that reduced deforestation and increased agricultural production can occur simultaneously in tropical forest frontiers, provided that land is available and policies promote the efficient use of already-cleared lands (intensification) while restricting deforestation. It remains uncertain whether government- and industry-led policies can contain deforestation if future market conditions favor another boom in agricultural expansion.",

      "abstract": "Amazon beef and soybean industries, the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation, are increasingly responsive to economic signals emanating from around the world, such as those associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, “mad cow disease”) outbreaks and China’s economic growth. The expanding role of these economic “teleconnections” (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3-year period (2002–2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large-scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship—including compliance with legislation—may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of “losing” their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society. The foot-and-mouth eradication system, in which geographic zones win permission to export beef, may provide an important model for the design of a low-cost, peer-enforced, socioenvironmental certification system that becomes the mechanism by which beef and soy industries gain access to markets outside the Amazon.",

      "abstract": "Almonds are a rich source of fatty acids and antioxidants, and their supplementation is known to significantly modulate serum lipids. The effects of almond on the skin's lipid barrier and the appearance of wrinkles have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of almond consumption on facial sebum production and wrinkles. Methods: This was a prospective, investigator‐blinded, randomized controlled trial in which subjects consumed 20% of their daily energy consumption in either almonds or a calorie‐matched snack for 16 weeks. This study was completed at the UC Davis Dermatology clinic. Participants were a volunteer sample of generally healthy postmenopausal females with Fitzpatrick skin types 1 and 2. A facial photograph and image analysis system was used to obtain standardized photographs and information on wrinkle width and severity at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Measurements of transepidermal water loss and sebum production were also completed at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Results: Fifty healthy postmenopausal females were recruited, 31 participants were enrolled, and 28 completed the study. Under photographic analysis, the almond group had significantly decreased wrinkle severity and width compared with the control group at 16 weeks (p < .02). Changes in skin barrier function were nonsignificant, measured by the transepidermal water loss (p = .65) between the almond and control groups relative to baseline after 16 weeks. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that daily almond consumption may reduce wrinkle severity in postmenopausal females to potentially have natural antiaging benefits.",

      "abstract": "Almond is the most important nut species worldwide and almond kernels show the highest levels of tocopherols among all nuts. In almond, tocopherols not only play a substantial role as a healthy food for human consumption, but also in protecting lipids against oxidation and, thus, lengthening the storage time of almond kernels. The main tocopherol homologues detected in almond in decreasing content and biological importance are α-, γ-, δ-, and β-tocopherol. Tocopherol concentration in almond depends on the genotype and the environment, such as the climatic conditions of the year and the growing management of the orchard. The range of variability for the different tocopherol homologues is of 335–657 mg/kg of almond oil for α-, 2–50 for γ-, and 0.1–22 for β-tocopherol. Drought and heat have been the most important stresses affecting tocopherol content in almond, with increased levels at higher temperatures and in water deficit conditions. The right cultivar and the most appropriate growing conditions may be selected to obtain crops with effective kernel storage and for the most beneficial effects of almond consumption for human nutrition and health",

      "abstract": "The decrease of stomatal conductance (gs) is one of the prime responses to water shortage and the main determinant of yield limitation in fruit trees. Understanding the mechanisms related to stomatal closure in response to imposed water stress is crucial for correct irrigation management. The loss of leaf hydraulic functioning is considered as one of the major factors triggering stomatal closure. Thus, we conducted an experiment to quantify the dehydration response of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) and its impact on gs in two Mediterranean fruit tree species, one deciduous (almond) and one evergreen (olive). Our hypothesis was that a higher Kleaf would be associated with a higher gs and that the reduction in Kleaf would predict the reduction in gs in both species. We measured Kleaf in olive and almond during a cycle of irrigation withholding. We also compared the results of two methods to measure Kleaf: dynamic rehydration kinetics and evaporative flux methods. In addition, determined gs, leaf water potential (Ψleaf), vein density, photosynthetic capacity and turgor loss point. Results showed that gs was higher in almond than in olive and so was Kleaf (Kmax = 4.70 and 3.42 mmol s−1 MPa−1 m−2, in almond and olive, respectively) for Ψleaf > −1.2 MPa. At greater water stress levels than −1.2 MPa, however, Kleaf decreased exponentially, being similar for both species, while gs was still higher in almond than in olive. We conclude that although the Kleaf decrease with increasing water stress does not drive unequivocally the gs response to water stress, Kleaf is the variable most strongly related to the gs response to water stress, especially in olive. Other variables such as the increase in abscisic acid (ABA) may be playing an important role in gs regulation, although in our study the gs–ABA relationship did not show a clear pattern.",

Thermography has been progressively introduced as a promising technique for irrigation scheduling and the assessing of crop-water status, especially when deficit irrigation is being implemented. However, an important limitation is related to the cost of the actual cameras, this being a severe limitation to its practical usage by farmers and technicians. This work evaluates the potential and the robustness of a thermal imaging camera that is connected to smartphone (Flir One) recently developed by Flir Systems Inc. as a first step to assess the crop water status. The trial was developed in mature almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) trees that are subjected to different irrigation treatments. Thermal information obtained by the Flir One camera was deal with the thermal information obtained with a conventional Thermal Camera (Flir SC660) with a high resolution, and subsequently, confronted with other related plant physiological parameters (leaf water potential, Ψleaf, and stomatal conductance, gs). Thermal imaging camera connected to smartphone provided useful information in estimating the crop-water status in almond trees, being a potential promising tool to accelerate the monitoring process and thereby enhance water-stress management of almond orchards",

      "abstract": "All fish eggs are surrounded by an envelope, called the zona pellucida (ZP), that plays various roles during oogenesis, egg deposition, fertilization, and embryogenesis. The fish egg ZP consists of only a few proteins that are homologs of mammalian ZP proteins ZP1, ZP3, and ZP4. Unlike the situation in mammals, in fishes there are often multiple copies of ZP genes, perhaps a consequence of ancient polyploidization, gene amplification, and mutation. Like mammalian ZP proteins, fish egg ZP1-like proteins exhibit conserved organization with distinct domains and motifs, but unlike mammalian ZP1 and ZP4 have a glutamine (Q)- and/or proline (P)-rich stretch as an N-terminal extension. Such extensions may play a role in assembly of ZP fibrils and/or account for certain properties of the fish egg ZP, such as elasticity. Recent proposals suggest that fish egg ZP proteins can adopt amyloid-like structures, serve as antifreeze proteins in Antarctic icefishes, and protect eggs subjected to desiccating conditions in small shallow pools. In this chapter, these and other aspects of fish egg ZP proteins are presented.",

      "title": "Egg size and offspring quality: a meta-analysis in birds",
      "abstract": "Parents affect offspring fitness by propagule size and quality, selection of oviposition site, quality of incubation, feeding of dependent young, and their defence against predators and parasites. Despite many case studies on each of these topics, this knowledge has not been rigorously integrated into individual parental care traits for any taxon. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of how parental care modifies offspring phenotypes. This meta-analysis of 283 studies with 1805 correlations between egg size and offspring quality in birds is intended to fill this gap. The large sample size enabled testing of how the magnitude of the relationship between egg size and offspring quality depends on a number of variables. Egg size was positively related to nearly all studied offspring traits across all stages of the offspring life cycle. Not surprisingly, the relationship was strongest at hatching but persisted until the post-fledging stage. Morphological traits were the most closely related to egg size but significant relationships were also found with hatching success, chick survival, and growth rate. Non-significant effect sizes were found for egg fertility, chick immunity, behaviour, and life-history or sexual traits. Effect size did not depend on whether chicks were raised by their natural parents or were cross-fostered to other territories. Effect size did not depend on species-specific traits such as developmental mode, clutch size, and relative size of the egg, but was larger if tested in captive compared to wild populations and between rather than within broods. In sum, published studies support the view that egg size affects juvenile survival. There are very few studies that tested the relationship between egg size and the fecundity component of offspring fitness, and no studies on offspring survival as adults or on global fitness. More data are also needed for the relationships between egg size and offspring behavioural and physiological traits. It remains to be established whether the relationship between egg size and offspring performance depends on the quality of the offspring environment. Positive effect sizes found in this study are likely to be driven by a causal effect of egg size on offspring quality. However, more studies that control for potential confounding effects of parental post-hatching care, genes, and egg composition are needed to establish firmly this causal link.",

      "abstract": "One central goal of evolutionary biology is to explain how biological diversity emerges and is maintained in nature. Given the complexity of the phenotype and the multifaceted nature of inheritance, modern evolutionary ecological studies rely heavily on the use of molecular tools. Here, we show how molecular tools help to gain insight into the role of egg coats (i.e. the extracellular structures surrounding eggs and embryos) in evolutionary diversification. Egg coats are maternally derived structures that have many biological functions from mediating fertilization to protecting the embryo from environmental hazards. They show great molecular, structural and functional diversity across species, but intraspecific variability and the role of ecology in egg coat evolution have largely been overlooked. Given that much of the variation that influences egg coat function is ultimately determined by their molecular phenotype, cutting-edge molecular tools (e.g. proteomics, glycomics and transcriptomics), combined with functional assays, are needed for rigorous inferences on their evolutionary ecology. Here, we identify key research areas and highlight emerging molecular techniques that can increase our understanding of the role of egg coats in the evolution of biological diversity, from adaptation to speciation.",

The data set contained 576 performance measurements from 34 trials. The trials were all conducted according to a similar experimental protocol from 1997 to 2012. The age of the animals ranged from 21 to 65 weeks. The experimental diets were predominantly wheat/SBM based, fed in mash form ad libitum. Depending on the trial and the treatment group considered, canthaxanthin supplementation was in the range of 0 to 8 mg/kg of feed. Using a linear mixed model regression applied to all 34 trials simultaneously, significant dose-dependent increases were found in egg yolk mass (+0.53% per ppm of canthaxanthin inclusion in the feed, P < 0.001), in egg mass (+0.47% per ppm, P = 0.0132), egg weight (+0.17% per ppm, P = 0.046), and in feed intake (+0.32% per ppm, P = 0.0054). A numerical increase was found in egg production (+0.28%, P = 0.14). The FCR decreased numerically (−0.24% per ppm, P = 0.36). The deposition of canthaxanthin in the egg yolk was 2.25 ppm per ppm of canthaxanthin in the feed (P < 0.001). It is concluded that in addition to egg yolk pigmentation, antioxidant effect, enhanced reproduction, and immune-modulation, canthaxanthin can significantly increase egg mass, thereby enhancing the productivity of the flock. Mechanisms relating to carotenoid metabolism and functions in avian species are a new research area that will require further investigation to explain the observed effects",

The aim of the present study was to identify different segments of consumers according to their motivation for following a vegan diet. Another objective was to analyse the attitudes of these consumers towards animal agriculture. The main focus was to determine whether all consumers following a vegan diet oppose animal agriculture in general or if some of these consumers accept certain forms of animal agriculture. The 2014 study, conducted at seven vegan supermarkets in Germany, was based on face-to-face interviews with 329 consumers following a vegan diet. The open question on consumer motivations for adopting a vegan diet revealed three main motives: Animal-related motives (mentioned by 89.7% of the respondents), motives related to personal well-being and/or health (69.3%), and environment-related motives (46.8%). The two-step cluster analysis identified five consumer segments with different motivations for following a vegan diet. The vast majority of respondents (81.8%) mentioned more than one motive. We conclude that making a dichotomous segmentation into ethical versus self-oriented consumers, as previous authors have done, disregards the fact that many consumers following a vegan diet are driven by more than one motive. The consumer segments had significantly different attitudes towards animal agriculture. We identified consumers following a vegan diet (about one third of the sample) who might be open to forms of animal agriculture guaranteeing animal welfare standards going beyond current practices.

One option to alleviate this conflict is to feed pets a diet devoid of animal ingredients—a ‘plant-based’ or ‘vegan’ diet. The number of pet owners who avoid animal products, either in their own or in their pets’ diet, is not currently known. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of meat-avoiding pet owners, identify concerns regarding conventional animal- and plant-based pet food, and estimate the number of pets fed a plant-based diet. A questionnaire was disseminated online to Englishspeaking pet owners (n = 3,673) to collect data regarding pet owner demographics, diet, pet type, pet diet, and concerns regarding pet foods. Results found that pet owners were more likely to be vegetarian (6.2%; 229/3,673) or vegan (5.8%; 212/3,673) than previously reported for members of the general population. With the exception of one dog owned by a vegetarian, vegans were the only pet owners who fed plant-based diets to their pets (1.6%; 59/3,673). Of the pet owners who did not currently feed plant-based diets but expressed interest in idng so, a large proportion (45%; 269/599) desired more information demonstrating the nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets. Amongst all pet owners, the concern most commonly reported regarding meat-based pet foods was for the welfare of farm animals (39%; 1,275/3,231). The most common concern regarding strictly plant-based pet foods was regarding the nutritional completeness of the diet (74%; 2,439/3,318). Amongst vegans, factors which predicted the feeding of plant-based diets to their pets were concern regarding the cost of plant-based diets, a lack of concern regarding plant-based diets being unnatural, and reporting no concern at all regarding plant-based diets for pets. Given these findings, further research is warranted to investigate plant-based nutrition for domestic dogs and cats.",

Nutrient intakes were estimated including fortification in foods, but excluding dietary supplements. Dietary supplementation practices were also evaluated. Highly significant differences were found in estimated nutrient intakes between meat eaters and vegans, with fish eaters and vegetarians usually having intermediate values. Meat eaters had the highest energy intakes, followed by fish eaters and vegetarians, whereas vegans had the lowest intakes. Vegans had the highest intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamins C and E, folate, magnesium, iron, and copper.

Two of the main problems of meat and products during processing and subsequent storage are lipid oxidation and deterioration due to microorganism growth. In this context, several packaging alternatives have been developed by meat industry in order to limit these losses and to extend the meat products´ shelf life. Over the last years, the use of active packaging has been proposed as an alternative to traditional packaging. The principle of active packaging, particularly antioxidant active packaging, consists of including active agents in the packaging which interact with meat and/or its environment, either by trapping pro-oxidant compounds or by releasing antioxidant compounds in order to delay degradation due to lipid oxidation. Therefore, the use of active packaging is presented as a future option to solve the problems derived from oxidative deterioration of meat and meat products. However, its use will depend on the costs involved in the development of this active packaging. Therefore, this review will give an overview about the use of active packaging and natural antioxidants, the active film development techniques, as well as the use of biopolymers as substitutes for synthetic polymers and their direct application in the meat industry.",

While dietary protein plays a key role in the prevention of PEM, it also plays a pivotal role in the environmental impact of the human diet. In search for sustainable dietary strategies to increase protein intake in older adults, this study investigated the readiness of older adults to accept the consumption of the following alternative, more sustainable protein sources: plant-based protein, insects, single-cell protein, and in vitro meat. Using ordinal logistic regression modeling, the associations of different food-related attitudes and behavior and sociodemographics with older adults’ acceptance to consume such protein sources were assessed. Results were obtained through a consumer survey among 1825 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or above in five EU countries (United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Finland). Dairy-based protein was generally the most accepted protein source in food products (75% of the respondents found its consumption acceptable or very acceptable). Plant-based protein was the most accepted alternative, more sustainable protein source (58%) followed by single-cell protein (20%), insect-based protein (9%), and in vitro meat-based protein (6%). We found that food fussiness is a barrier to acceptance, whereas green eating behavior and higher educational attainment are facilitators to older adults’ acceptance to eat protein from alternative, more sustainable sources. Health, sensory appeal, and price as food choice motives, as well as gender and country of residence were found to influence acceptance, although not consistently across all the protein sources. Findings suggest that there is a window of opportunity to increase older adults’ acceptance of alternative, more sustainable protein sources and in turn increase protein intake in an environmentally sustainable way in EU older adults.",

Few studies exist on carcass characteristics of crossbred dairy progeny originating from dairy herds as well as their dams. The objective of the present study was to quantify, using a national database, the carcass characteristics of young animals and cows differing in their fraction of Jersey. The data set consisted of 117,593 young animals and 42,799 cows. The associations between a combination of sire and dam breed proportion (just animal breed proportion when the dependent variable was on cows) with age at slaughter (just for young animals), carcass weight, conformation, fat score, price per kilogram, and total carcass value were estimated using mixed models that accounted for covariances among herdmates of the same sex slaughtered in close proximity in time; we also accounted for age at slaughter in young animals (which was substituted with carcass weight and carcass fat score when the dependent variable was age at slaughter), animal sex, parity of the cow or dam (where relevant), and temporal effects represented by a year-by-month 2-way interaction. For young animals, the heaviest of the dairy carcasses were from the mating of a HolsteinFriesian dam and a Holstein-Friesian sire (323.34 kg), whereas the lightest carcasses were from the mating of a purebred Jersey dam to a purebred Jersey sire which were 46.31 kg lighter (standard error of the difference = 1.21 kg). The young animal carcass weight of an F1 Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross was 20.4 to 27.0 kg less than that of a purebred Holstein-Friesian animal. The carcass conformation of a Holstein-Friesian young animal was 26% superior to that of a purebred Jersey, translating to a difference of 0.78 conformation units on a scale of 1 to 15. Purebred Holstein-Friesians produced carcasses with less fat than their purebred Jersey counterparts. The difference in carcass price per kilogram among the alternative sire-dam breed combinations investigated was minimal, although large differences existed among the different breed types for overall carcass value; the carcass value of a Holstein-Friesian animal was 20% greater than that of a Jersey animal. Purebred Jersey animals required, on average, 21 d longer to reach a given carcass weight and fat score relative to a purebred Holstein-Friesian. The difference in age at slaughter between a purebred Holstein-Friesian animal and the mating between a Holstein-Friesian sire with a Jersey dam, and vice versa, was between 7.0 and 8.9 d. A 75.8-kg difference in carcass weight existed between the carcass of a purebred Jersey cow and that of a Holstein-Friesian cow; a 50% Holstein–Friesian-50% Jersey cow had a carcass 42.0 kg lighter than that of a purebred Holstein-Friesian cow. Carcass conformation was superior in purebred Holstein-Friesian compared with purebred Jersey cows. Results from this study represent useful input parameters to populate simulation models of alternative breeding programs on dairy farms, and to help beef farmers evaluate the cost-benefit of rearing, for slaughter, animals differing in Jersey fraction.",

      "title": "More room for legume – Consumer acceptance of meat substitution with classic, processed and meat-resembling legume products",
      "abstract": "The substitution of meat with legumes is one way of making food consumption more sustainable. The substitution would ease the debate on food security and is aligned with the recommendations of climate change experts. Consumer preferences on whether meat should be substituted and how meat can be substituted are heterogeneous. This article explores consumers' acceptance of replacing meat with legumes, their acceptance of meat alternatives made from legumes and their acceptance of processed legumes in general. Consumer samples were drawn from Germany (GER: N = 633) and New Zealand (NZ: N = 445). The samples reflect the underlying age, gender and income distributions. Two separate latent class analyses reveal seven consumer types with five in each country. A large cluster from both countries will not consider substituting meat with legumes or buying processed legume products. Another cluster will consider processed legume products if the products are not marketed as an alternative to meat. Although they do not use them regularly, many consumers in NZ are open to using meat substitutes made from legumes. Another group would prefer to directly substitute meat with specific legumes rather than having highly processed products. We discuss the cluster specific findings and how to develop consumers’ acceptance of meat substitution with respect to each cluster.",

      "title": "Quality, composition, and consumer evaluation of meat from slow-growing broilers relative to commercial broilers",
      "abstract": "During the last few years, slow-growing broiler market share is steadily increasing. Hence, new strains of slow-growing broilers are being introduced to meet the demand. Indbro broiler is such one strain developed to cater the demand for slow-growing broiler meat. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the meat quality of this new variety of slow-growing broiler meat. In this context, the present study was undertaken to compare the meat quality, composition, and consumer preference of slow-growing and commercial white broiler chicken meats. Commercial white broilers (vencobb strain) used in this study weighed approximately 2.0 kg and are 36 days old. The slow-growing birds were from Indbro strain which is multicolored and costing about 30 to 50% higher price in local markets. The dressing percentage, breast meat yield, meat bone ratio, and muscle fiber diameter were higher (P < 0.05) in commercial broilers. However, the cooking yield of drumstick and breast meat did not differ significantly between 2 genotypes. Shear force value and protein content of thigh meat were higher (P < 0.05) in slowgrowing broiler as compared to the commercial broiler. Slow-growing boiler breast meat contains significantly (P < 0.05) lower total fatty acid and saturated fatty acid content. A significant (P < 0.05) percentage (67%) of consumers preferred the meat and meat products prepared from slow-growing broiler meat. During “paired comparison” test the semi-trained panelists could able to differentiate between slow-growing and fast-growing broiler meat. All the sensory attributes of meat and meat products from slow-growing broilers were similar to commercial broiler. Therefore, slow-growing broiler chicken has the potential to provide the tasty and alternate poultry meat to consumers.",

      "title": "Selection and consumption of lunches by National School Lunch Program participants",
      "abstract": "The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to offer a variety of healthy food options each day. Using digital photography data collected from two suburban elementary schools in the spring of 2013, we examine NSLP participant’s selection and consumption of all five NSLP lunch components ((1) milk, (2) vegetable, (3) fruit, (4) meat/meat alternate (MA), and (5) grain). We use logit regressions to analyze the selection of the various lunch components by race/ethnicity, gender, grade, and household income level. In addition, ordinary least squares regressions are used to analyze the selection and consumption of calories contained in the chosen lunch and by lunch component. Selection and consumption varied by race, ethnicity, gender, and eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. For example, black students consumed fewer calories than white students, black and Hispanic students consumed fewer calories from milk than white students, and free and reduced-price lunch eligible students consumed more calories from milk and fewer calories from grains. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we determine that school lunches are an important part of school-day food intake for NSLP participants. These results provide guidance for making changes within a cafeteria’s offerings to increase the selection of healthy foods.",

      "abstract": "Efforts to reduce plate-waste (PW) are limited to those by a dietitian who serves the entire school rather than a better characterization of individuals who are served. We tested the hypothesis that children reporting habitual PW would have different physical or dietary characteristics compared with children without PW. Participants were 407 children aged 6 to 9 years in elementary schools in Kyeonggi, Korea. Information on eating behavior and food preference was collected using a questionnaire administered by parents. Among them, 91 students participated further in anthropometry, step counting, taste acuity tests, and nutrition intake from school lunches. Participants were divided into tertiles according to total frequency of leaving PW from each meal on a typical day: no PW, moderate PW, and habitual PW. Children with habitual PW showed several undesirable characteristics: consuming less of various vegetables, eating only what they like, poor table manners, and frequent consumption of street foods and cookies/beverages/fast foods. Whereas height, weight, and obesity index as well as taste acuity and daily steps in the habitual PW group were not significantly different, intakes of potassium, niacin, and folate were significantly lower compared with the other groups. Therefore, habitual PW did not seem to result from having a lower energy requirement or different taste acuity, or result in observed slowed growth, but it could place children at a risk for insufficient nutritional intake, consequently impairing growth and general health. The results emphasize the parental role in shaping children's diet and provide information for developing strategies to reduce PW of individual children.",

      "title": "Amount of Time to Eat Lunch Is Associated with Children’s Selection and Consumption of School Meal Entrée, Fruits, Vegetables, and Milk",
      "abstract": "Background There are currently no national standards for school lunch period length and little is known about the association between the amount of time students have to eat and school food selection and consumption. Objective Our aim was to examine plate-waste measurements from students in the control arm of the Modifying Eating and Lifestyles at School study (2011 to 2012 school year) to determine the association between amount of time to eat and school meal selection and consumption. Design We used a prospective study design using up to six repeated measures among students during the school year. Participants/setting One thousand and one students in grades 3 to 8 attending six participating elementary and middle schools in an urban, low-income school district where lunch period lengths varied from 20 to 30 minutes were included. Main outcome measures School food selection and consumption were collected using plate-waste methodology. Statistical analyses performed Logistic regression and mixed-model analysis of variance was used to examine food selection and consumption. Results Compared with meal-component selection when students had at least 25 minutes to eat, students were significantly less likely to select a fruit (44% vs 57%; P<0.0001) when they had <20 minutes to eat. There were no significant differences in entrée, milk, or vegetable selections. Among those who selected a meal component, students with <20 minutes to eat consumed 13% less of their entrée (P<0.0001), 10% less of their milk (P<0.0001), and 12% less of their vegetable (P<0.0001) compared with students who had at least 25 minutes to eat. Conclusions During the school year, a substantial number of students had insufficient time to eat, which was associated with significantly decreased entrée, milk, and vegetable consumption compared with students who had more time to eat. School policies that encourage lunches with at least 25 minutes of seated time might reduce food waste and improve dietary intake.",

      "title": "Impact of the New U.S. Department of Agriculture School Meal Standards on Food Selection, Consumption, and Waste",
      "abstract": "Background: The U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently made substantial changes to the school meal standards. The media and public outcry have suggested that this has led to substantially more food waste. Purpose: School meal selection, consumption, and waste were assessed before and after implementation of the new school meal standards. Methods: Plate waste data were collected in four schools in an urban, low-income school district. Logistic regression and mixed-model ANOVA were used to estimate the differences in selection and consumption of school meals before (fall 2011) and after implementation (fall 2012) of the new standards among 1030 elementary and middle school children. Analyses were conducted in 2013. Results: After the new standards were implemented, fruit selection increased by 23.0% and entrée and vegetable selection remained unchanged. Additionally, post-implementation entrée consumption increased by 15.6%, vegetable consumption increased by 16.2%, and fruit consumption remained the same. Milk selection and consumption decreased owing to an unrelated milk policy change. Conclusions: Although food waste levels were substantial both pre- and post-implementation, the new guidelines have positively affected school meal selection and consumption. Despite the increased vegetable portion size requirement, consumption increased and led to significantly more cups of vegetables consumed. Significantly more students selected a fruit, whereas the overall percentage of fruit consumed remained the same, resulting in more students consuming fruits. Contrary to media reports, these results suggest that the new school meal standards have improved students’ overall diet quality. Legislation to weaken the standards is not warranted.",
