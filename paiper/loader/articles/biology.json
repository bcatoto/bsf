        "abstract": "Accurately predicting biological impacts of climate change is necessary to guide policy. However, the resolution of climate data could be affecting the accuracy of climate change impact assessments. Here, we review the spatial and temporal resolution of climate data used in impact assessments and demonstrate that these resolutions are often too coarse relative to biologically relevant scales. We then develop a framework that partitions climate into three important components: trend, variance, and autocorrelation. We apply this framework to map different global climate regimes and identify where coarse climate data is most and least likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments. We show that impact assessments for many large mammals and birds use climate data with a spatial resolution similar to the biologically relevant area encompassing population dynamics. Conversely, impact assessments for many small mammals, herpetofauna, and plants use climate data with a spatial resolution that is orders of magnitude larger than the area encompassing population dynamics. Most impact assessments also use climate data with a coarse temporal resolution. We suggest that climate data with a coarse spatial resolution is likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments the most in climates with high spatial trend and variance (e.g., much of western North and South America) and the least in climates with low spatial trend and variance (e.g., the Great Plains of the USA). Climate data with a coarse temporal resolution is likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments the most in the northern half of the northern hemisphere where temporal climatic variance is high. Our framework provides one way to identify where improving the resolution of climate data will have the largest impact on the accuracy of biological predictions under climate change.",

        "abstract": "Climate, physical landscapes, and biota interact to generate heterogeneous hydrologic conditions in space and over time, which are reflected in spatial patterns of species distributions. As these species distributions respond to rapid climate change, microrefugia may support local species persistence in the face of deteriorating climatic suitability. Recent focus on temperature as a determinant of microrefugia insufficiently accounts for the importance of hydrologic processes and changing water availability with changing climate. Where water scarcity is a major limitation now or under future climates, hydrologic microrefugia are likely to prove essential for species persistence, particularly for sessile species and plants. Zones of high relative water availability - mesic microenvironments - are generated by a wide array of hydrologic processes, and may be loosely coupled to climatic processes and therefore buffered from climate change. Here, we review the mechanisms that generate mesic microenvironments and their likely robustness in the face of climate change. We argue that mesic microenvironments will act as species-specific refugia only if the nature and space/time variability in water availability are compatible with the ecological requirements of a target species. We illustrate this argument with case studies drawn from California oak woodland ecosystems. We posit that identification of hydrologic refugia could form a cornerstone of climate-cognizant conservation strategies, but that this would require improved understanding of climate change effects on key hydrologic processes, including frequently cryptic processes such as groundwater flow.",

        "title": "Assessing Mammal Exposure to Climate Change in the Brazilian Amazon",
        "abstract": "Human-induced climate change is considered a conspicuous threat to biodiversity in the 21st century. Species' response to climate change depends on their exposition, sensitivity and ability to adapt to novel climates. Exposure to climate change is however uneven within species' range, so that some populations may be more at risk than others. Identifying the regions most exposed to climate change is therefore a first and pivotal step on determining species' vulnerability across their geographic ranges. Here, we aimed at quantifying mammal local exposure to climate change across species' ranges. We identified areas in the Brazilian Amazon where mammals will be critically exposed to non-analogue climates in the future with different variables predicted by 15 global circulation climate forecasts. We also built a null model to assess the effectiveness of the Amazon protected areas in buffering the effects of climate change on mammals, using an innovative and more realistic approach. We found that 85% of species are likely to be exposed to non-analogue climatic conditions in more than 80% of their ranges by 2070. That percentage is even higher for endemic mammals; almost all endemic species are predicted to be exposed in more than 80% of their range. Exposure patterns also varied with different climatic variables and seem to be geographically structured. Western and northern Amazon species are more likely to experience temperature anomalies while northeastern species will be more affected by rainfall abnormality. We also observed an increase in the number of critically-exposed species from 2050 to 2070. Overall, our results indicate that mammals might face high exposure to climate change and that protected areas will probably not be efficient enough to avert those impacts.",

        "title": "Implications of climate change for the fishes of the British Isles",
        "abstract": "Recent climatic change has been recorded across the globe. Although environmental change is a characteristic feature of life on Earth and has played a major role in the evolution and global distribution of biodiversity, predicted future rates of climatic change, especially in temperature, are such that they will exceed any that has occurred over recent geological time. Climate change is considered as a key threat to biodiversity and to the structure and function of ecosystems that may already be subject to significant anthropogenic stress. The current understanding of climate change and its likely consequences for the fishes of Britain and Ireland and the surrounding seas are reviewed through a series of case studies detailing the likely response of several marine, diadromous and freshwater fishes to climate change. Changes in climate, and in particular, temperature have and will continue to affect fish at all levels of biological organization: cellular, individual, population, species, community and ecosystem, influencing physiological and ecological processes in a number of direct, indirect and complex ways. The response of fishes and of other aquatic taxa will vary according to their tolerances and life stage and are complex and difficult to predict. Fishes may respond directly to climate-change-related shifts in environmental processes or indirectly to other influences, such as community-level interactions with other taxa. However, the ability to adapt to the predicted changes in climate will vary between species and between habitats and there will be winners and losers. In marine habitats, recent changes in fish community structure will continue as fishes shift their distributions relative to their temperature preferences. This may lead to the loss of some economically important cold-adapted species such as Gadus morhua and Clupea harengus from some areas around Britain and Ireland, and the establishment of some new, warm-adapted species. Increased temperatures are likely to favour cool-adapted (e.g. Perca fluviatilis) and warm-adapted freshwater fishes (e.g. roach Rutilus rutilus and other cyprinids) whose distribution and reproductive success may currently be constrained by temperature rather than by cold-adapted species (e.g. salmonids). Species that occur in Britain and Ireland that are at the edge of their distribution will be most affected, both negatively and positively. Populations of conservation importance (e.g.Salvelinus alpinus and Coregonus spp.) may decline irreversibly. However, changes in food-web dynamics and physiological adaptation, for example because of climate change, may obscure or alter predicted responses. The residual inertia in climate systems is such that even a complete cessation in emissions would still leave fishes exposed to continued climate change for at least half a century. Hence, regardless of the success or failure of programmes aimed at curbing climate change, major changes in fish communities can be expected over the next 50 years with a concomitant need to adapt management strategies accordingly.",

        "abstract": "The extent to which key biological processes, such as sex determination, respond to environmental fluctuations is fundamental for assessing species' susceptibility to ongoing climate change. Few studies, however, address how climate affects offspring sex in the wild. We monitored two climatically distinct populations of the viviparous skink Niveoscincus ocellatus for 16 years, recording environmental temperatures, offspring sex and date of birth. We found strong population-specific effects of temperature on offspring sex, with female offspring more common in warm years at the lowland site but no effect at the highland site. In contrast, date of birth advanced similarly in response to temperature at both sites. These results suggest strong population-specific effects of temperature on offspring sex that are independent of climatic effects on other physiological processes. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in sex ratios under climate change.",

        "abstract": "We review the phenomenon of condition-dependent sex-where individuals' condition affects the likelihood that they will reproduce sexually rather than asexually. In recent years, condition-dependent sex has been studied both theoretically and empirically. Empirical results in microbes, fungi and plants support the theoretical prediction that negative condition-dependent sex, in which individuals in poor condition are more likely to reproduce sexually, can be evolutionarily advantageous under a wide range of settings. Here, we review the evidence for condition-dependent sex and its potential implications for the long-term survival and adaptability of populations. We conclude by asking why condition-dependent sex is not more commonly observed, and by considering generalizations of condition-dependent sex that might apply even for obligate sexuals.This article is part of the themed issue 'Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.",

        "abstract": "Fungi are a diverse group of organisms with a huge variation in reproductive strategy. While almost all species can reproduce sexually, many reproduce asexually most of the time. When sexual reproduction does occur, large variation exists in the amount of in- and out-breeding. While budding yeast is expected to outcross only once every 10 000 generations, other fungi are obligate outcrossers with well-mixed panmictic populations. In this review, we give an overview of the costs and benefits of sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi, and the mechanisms that evolved in fungi to reduce the costs of either mode. The proximate molecular mechanisms potentiating outcrossing and meiosis appear to be present in nearly all fungi, making them of little use for predicting outcrossing rates, but also suggesting the absence of true ancient asexual lineages. We review how population genetic methods can be used to estimate the frequency of sex in fungi and provide empirical data that support a mixed mode of reproduction in many species with rare to frequent sex in between rounds of mitotic reproduction. Finally, we highlight how these estimates might be affected by the fungus-specific mechanisms that evolved to reduce the costs of sexual and asexual reproduction.This article is part of the themed issue 'Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.",

        "title": "Diploidy and the selective advantage for sexual reproduction in unicellular organisms",
        "abstract": "This article develops mathematical models describing the evolutionary dynamics of both asexually and sexually reproducing populations of diploid unicellular organisms. The asexual and sexual life cycles are based on the asexual and sexual life cycles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Baker's yeast, which normally reproduces by asexual budding, but switches to sexual reproduction when stressed. The mathematical models consider three reproduction pathways: (1) Asexual reproduction, (2) self-fertilization, and (3) sexual reproduction. We also consider two forms of genome organization. In the first case, we assume that the genome consists of two multi-gene chromosomes, whereas in the second case, we consider the opposite extreme and assume that each gene defines a separate chromosome, which we call the multi-chromosome genome. These two cases are considered to explore the role that recombination has on the mutation-selection balance and the selective advantage of the various reproduction strategies. We assume that the purpose of diploidy is to provide redundancy, so that damage to a gene may be repaired using the other, presumably undamaged copy (a process known as homologous recombination repair). As a result, we assume that the fitness of the organism only depends on the number of homologous gene pairs that contain at least one functional copy of a given gene. If the organism has at least one functional copy of every gene in the genome, we assume a fitness of 1. In general, if the organism has l homologous pairs that lack a functional copy of the given gene, then the fitness of the organism is kappa(l). The kappa(l) are assumed to be monotonically decreasing, so that kappa(0) = 1 > kappa(1) > kappa(2) > cdots, three dots, centered > kappa(infinity) = 0. For nearly all of the reproduction strategies we consider, we find, in the limit of large N, that the mean fitness at mutation-selection balance is max{2e(-mu) - 1,0} where N is the number of genes in the haploid set of the genome, epsilon is the probability that a given DNA template strand of a given gene produces a mutated daughter during replication, and mu = Nepsilon. The only exception is the sexual reproduction pathway for the multi-chromosomed genome. Assuming a multiplicative fitness landscape where kappa(l) = alpha(l) for alpha in (0, 1), this strategy is found to have a mean fitness that exceeds the mean fitness of all the other strategies. Furthermore, while other reproduction strategies experience a total loss of viability due to the steady accumulation of deleterious mutations once mu exceeds [Formula: see text] no such transition occurs in the sexual pathway. Indeed, in the limit as alpha --> 1 for the multiplicative landscape, we can show that the mean fitness for the sexual pathway with the multi-chromosomed genome converges to e(-2mu), which is always positive. We explicitly allow for mitotic recombination in this study, which, in contrast to previous studies using different models, does not have any advantage over other asexual reproduction strategies. The results of this article provide a basis for understanding the selective advantage of the specific meiotic pathway that is employed by sexually reproducing organisms. The results of this article also suggest an explanation for why unicellular organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) switch to a sexual mode of reproduction when stressed. While the results of this article are based on modeling mutation-propagation in unicellular organisms, they nevertheless suggest that, in more complex organisms with significantly larger genomes, sex is necessary to prevent the loss of viability of a population due to genetic drift. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the results of this article demonstrate a selective advantage for sexual reproduction with fewer and much less restrictive assumptions than those of previous studies.",

        "title": "Constraints on the evolution of asexual reproduction",
        "abstract": "Sexual reproduction is almost ubiquitous among multicellular organisms even though it entails severe fitness costs. To resolve this apparent paradox, an extensive body of research has been devoted to identifying the selective advantages of recombination that counteract these costs. Yet, how easy is it to make the transition to asexual reproduction once sexual reproduction has been established for a long time? The present review approaches this question by considering factors that impede the evolution of parthenogenesis in animals. Most importantly, eggs need a diploid chromosome set in most species in order to develop normally. Next, eggs may need to be activated by sperm, and sperm may also contribute centrioles and other paternal factors to the zygote. Depending on how diploidy is achieved mechanistically, further problems may arise in offspring that stem from 'inbreeding depression' or inappropriate sex determination systems. Finally, genomic imprinting is another well-known barrier to the evolution of asexuality in mammals. Studies on species with occasional, deficient parthenogenesis indicate that the relative importance of these constraints may vary widely. The intimate evolutionary relations between haplodiploidy and parthenogenesis as well as implications for the clade selection hypothesis of the maintenance of sexual reproduction are also discussed.",

        "title": "How oxygen gave rise to eukaryotic sex",
        "abstract": "How did full meiotic eukaryotic sex evolve and what was the immediate advantage allowing it to develop? We propose that the crucial determinant can be found in internal reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation at the start of eukaryotic evolution approximately 2 × 109 years ago. The large amount of ROS coming from a bacterial endosymbiont gave rise to DNA damage and vast increases in host genome mutation rates. Eukaryogenesis and chromosome evolution represent adaptations to oxidative stress. The host, an archaeon, most probably already had repair mechanisms based on DNA pairing and recombination, and possibly some kind of primitive cell fusion mechanism. The detrimental effects of internal ROS formation on host genome integrity set the stage allowing evolution of meiotic sex from these humble beginnings. Basic meiotic mechanisms thus probably evolved in response to endogenous ROS production by the 'pre-mitochondrion'. This alternative to mitosis is crucial under novel, ROS-producing stress situations, like extensive motility or phagotrophy in heterotrophs and endosymbiontic photosynthesis in autotrophs. In multicellular eukaryotes with a germline-soma differentiation, meiotic sex with diploid-haploid cycles improved efficient purging of deleterious mutations. Constant pressure of endogenous ROS explains the ubiquitous maintenance of meiotic sex in practically all eukaryotic kingdoms. Here, we discuss the relevant observations underpinning this model.",

        "abstract": "Theories for the origin of sex traditionally start with an asexual mitosing cell and add recombination, thereby deriving meiosis from mitosis. Though sex was clearly present in the eukaryote common ancestor, the order of events linking the origin of sex and the origin of mitosis is unknown. Here, we present an evolutionary inference for the origin of sex starting with a bacterial ancestor of mitochondria in the cytosol of its archaeal host. We posit that symbiotic association led to the origin of mitochondria and gene transfer to host's genome, generating a nucleus and a dedicated translational compartment, the eukaryotic cytosol, in which-by virtue of mitochondria-metabolic energy was not limiting. Spontaneous protein aggregation (monomer polymerization) and Adenosine Tri-phosphate (ATP)-dependent macromolecular movement in the cytosol thereby became selectable, giving rise to continuous microtubule-dependent chromosome separation (reduction division). We propose that eukaryotic chromosome division arose in a filamentous, syncytial, multinucleated ancestor, in which nuclei with insufficient chromosome numbers could complement each other through mRNA in the cytosol and generate new chromosome combinations through karyogamy. A syncytial (or coenocytic, a synonym) eukaryote ancestor, or Coeca, would account for the observation that the process of eukaryotic chromosome separation is more conserved than the process of eukaryotic cell division. The first progeny of such a syncytial ancestor were likely equivalent to meiospores, released into the environment by the host's vesicle secretion machinery. The natural ability of archaea (the host) to fuse and recombine brought forth reciprocal recombination among fusing (syngamy and karyogamy) progeny-sex-in an ancestrally meiotic cell cycle, from which the simpler haploid and diploid mitotic cell cycles arose. The origin of eukaryotes was the origin of vertical lineage inheritance, and sex was required to keep vertically evolving lineages viable by rescuing the incipient eukaryotic lineage from Muller's ratchet. The origin of mitochondria was, in this view, the decisive incident that precipitated symbiosis-specific cell biological problems, the solutions to which were the salient features that distinguish eukaryotes from prokaryotes: A nuclear membrane, energetically affordable ATP-dependent protein-protein interactions in the cytosol, and a cell cycle involving reduction division and reciprocal recombination (sex).",

Using this approach, McDonald et al. recently demonstrated that sex uncouples beneficial and deleterious mutations, allowing selection to proceed more effectively with sex than without.

Does the cost deviate from twofold? What other factors make sex costly? How should the costs of sex be empirically measured?

Some polypeptides are more abundant in putative epidermal stem cells than in TA cells, but no polypeptide confined to the stem cells has yet been identified. Here we show that the p63 transcription factor, a p53 homologue essential for regenerative proliferation in epithelial development, distinguishes human keratinocyte stem cells from their TA progeny. Within the cornea, nuclear p63 is expressed by the basal cells of the limbal epithelium, but not by TA cells covering the corneal surface. Human keratinocyte stem and TA cells when isolated in culture give rise to holoclones and paraclones, respectively. We show by clonal analysis that p63 is abundantly expressed by epidermal and limbal holoclones, but is undetectable in paraclones. TA keratinocytes, immediately after their withdrawal from the stem cell compartment (meroclones), have greatly reduced p63, even though they possess very appreciable proliferative capacity. Clonal evolution (i.e., generation of TA cells from precursor stem cells) is promoted by the sigma isoform of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Keratinocytes whose 14-3-3σ has been down-regulated remain in the stem cell compartment and maintain p63 during serial cultivation. The identification of p63 as a keratinocyte stem cell marker will be of practical importance for the clinical application of epithelial cultures in cell therapy as well as for studies on epithelial tumorigenesis.",

They target multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptors and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors.6 Sorafenib and sunitinib have been beneficial in the treatment of metastatic renal-cell cancer when used alone.7,8 Sorafenib monotherapy is also active in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma9 and was recently approved by the FDA for this indication.\n\nThe survival benefits of these treatments are relatively modest (usually measured in months), with the possible exception of the benefits for patients with renal-cell carcinoma. These treatments are also costly10 and have toxic side effects.11,12 These concerns raise the following questions with respect to improving antiangiogenic therapy: How do such drugs work, and how does bevacizumab increase the efficacy of chemotherapy? Several theories have been postulated,13-16 including the theory that antiangiogenic drugs improve chemotherapy by causing “vessel normalization” in tumors (see Appendix 1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). How do tumors become resistant to antiangiogenic drugs? Are there clinically useful markers that can predict the efficacy of this class of drug? Are there promising surrogate pharmacodynamic biomarkers that will help to determine the best dose of a particular agent?

What accounts for the side effects of these agents?11,12\n\nMany recent discoveries have the potential not only to answer some of these questions but also to indicate new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.

Infiltrates of inflammatory cells present in human tumors are chronic in nature and are enriched in regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as myeloid suppressor cells (MSC). Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment not only fail to exercise antitumor effector functions, but they are co-opted to promote tumor growth. Sustained activation of the NF-κB pathway in the tumor milieu represents one mechanism that appears to favor tumor survival and drive abortive activation of immune cells. The result is tumor escape from the host immune system. Tumor escape is accomplished through the activation of one or several molecular mechanisms that lead to inhibition of immune cell functions or to apoptosis of anti-tumor effector cells. The ability to block tumor escape depends on a better understanding of cellular and molecular pathways operating in the tumor microenvironment. Novel therapeutic strategies that emerge are designed to change the pro-tumor microenvironment to one favoring acute responses and potent anti-tumor activity.",

Realization of this idea has gained momentum with development of high speed automation and the falling cost of gene sequencing and synthesis following the completion of the human genome project. Synthetic biology will certainly be instrumental in shaping the development of varying areas ranging from biomedicine, biopharmaceuticals, chemical production, food and dairy quality monitoring, packaging, and storage of food and dairy products, bioremediation and bioenergy production, etc. However, potential dangers of using synthetic life forms have to be acknowledged and adoption of policies by the scientific community to ensure safe practice while making important advancements in the ever expanding field of synthetic biology is to be fully supported and implemented.",

        "abstract": "Self-organization refers to the emergence of an overall order in time and space of a given system that results from the collective interactions of its individual components. This concept has been widely recognized as a core principle in pattern formation for multi-component systems of the physical, chemical and biological world. It can be distinguished from self-assembly by the constant input of energy required to maintain order-and self-organization therefore typically occurs in non-equilibrium or dissipative systems. Cells, with their constant energy consumption and myriads of local interactions between distinct proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, represent the perfect playground for self-organization. It therefore comes as no surprise that many properties and features of self-organized systems, such as spontaneous formation of patterns, nonlinear coupling of reactions, bi-stable switches, waves and oscillations, are found in all aspects of modern cell biology. Ultimately, self-organization lies at the heart of the robustness and adaptability found in cellular and organismal organization, and hence constitutes a fundamental basis for natural selection and evolution.This article is part of the theme issue 'Self-organization in cell biology'.",

Inarguably, the maturation of molecular biology tools has significantly contributed to the identification of genetic loci that underlie normal and aberrant developmental programs. In combination with cell biology approaches, these tools have begun to elucidate the spatiotemporal expression and function of developmentally-regulated proteins. The emergence of quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) for biological applications has accelerated the pace at which these proteins can be functionally characterized, driving the construction of an increasingly detailed systems biology picture of developmental processes. Here, we review the quantitative MS-based proteomic technologies that have contributed significantly to understanding the role of proteome regulation in developmental processes. We provide a brief overview of these methodologies, focusing on their ability to provide precise and accurate proteome measurements. We then highlight the use of discovery-based and targeted mass spectrometry approaches in model systems to study cellular differentiation states, tissue phenotypes, and spatiotemporal subcellular organization. We also discuss the current application and future perspectives of MS proteomics to study PTM coordination and the role of protein complexes during development.",

        "abstract": "What is life? is an ultimate biological quest for the principle that makes organisms alive. This 'WIL problem' is not, however, a simple one that we have a straightforward strategy to attack. From the beginning, molecular biology tried to identify molecules that bear the essence of life: the double helical DNA represented replication, and enzymes were micro-actuators of biological activities. A dominating idea behind these mainstream biological studies relies on the identification of life-bearing molecules, which themselves are models of life. Another, prevalent idea emphasizes that life resides in the whole system of an organism, but not in some particular molecules. The behavior of a complex system may be considered to embody the essence of life. The thermodynamic view of life system in the early 20th century was remodeled as physics of complex systems and systems biology. The two views contrast with each other, but they are no longer heritage of the historical dualism in biology, such as mechanism/materialism versus vitalism, or reductionism versus holism. These two views are both materialistic and mechanistic, and act as driving forces of modern biology. In reality, molecules function in a context of systems, whereas systems presuppose functional molecules. A key notion to reconcile this conflict is that subjects of biological studies are given before we start to study them. Cell- or organism-level biology is destined to the dialectic of molecules and systems, but this antagonism can be resolved by dynamic thinking involving biological evolution.",

Thus, mutations in functional sites can severely affect the overall phenotype. Progress of genome sequencing projects has yielded a wealth of information on single nucleotide variants (SNVs), especially those with less than 1% minor allele frequency (rare variants). To understand the functional influence of genetic variants at a protein level, we investigated the relationship between SNVs and protein functional sites in terms of minor allele frequency and the structural position of variants. As a result, we observed that SNVs were less abundant at ligand binding sites, which is consistent with a previous study on SNVs and protein interaction sites. Additionally, we found that non-rare variants tended to be located slightly apart from enzyme active sites. Examination of non-rare variants revealed that most of the mutations resulted in moderate changes of the physico-chemical properties of amino acids, suggesting the existence of functional constraints. In conclusion, this study shows that the mapping of genetic variants on protein structures could be a powerful approach to evaluate the functional impact of rare genetic variations.",

Such heterogeneity decreases the reproducibility of research. Thus, methods related to the detection, reduction, and control of heterogeneity in experiments involving human PSCs need to be developed.

Angiogenesis play an important role in post-stroke recovery. However, no studies have yet been conducted to systemically examine the effect and the underlying mechanism of iMSC-sEV on angiogenesis under brain ischemia conditions.\n\nMethods: Ischemic stroke model was performed in rats induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the pro-angiogenic capacity of iMSC-sEV was measured. The in vitro effects of iMSC-sEV on the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells were investigated, respectively. Autophagy and autophagy-related signaling pathway were detected in vivo and in vitro.\n\nResults: We found that iMSC-sEV significantly reduced infarct volume, enhanced angiogenesis, and alleviated long-term neurological deficits in rats after stroke. We also demonstrated that iMSC-sEV increased migration and tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro. A further mechanism study revealed that the pro-angiogenic effect of iMSC-sEV was correlated with a reduction in autophagy. Furthermore, iMSC-sEV significantly activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and suppression of STAT3 abolished iMSC-sEV-induced inhibition of autophagy and promotion of angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, our data indicate that iMSC-sEV promote angiogenesis after ischemic stroke, potentially, by inhibiting autophagy, a process that is partially dependent on STAT3 activation.",

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose- Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) obtained from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were shown to induce neurological recovery after focal cerebral ischemia in rodents and to reverse postischemic lymphopenia in peripheral blood. Since peripheral blood cells, especially polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), contribute to ischemic brain injury, we analyzed brain leukocyte responses to sEVs and investigated the role of PMNs in sEV-induced neuroprotection. Methods- Male C57Bl6/j mice were exposed to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion. After reperfusion, vehicle or sEVs prepared from conditioned media of MSCs raised from bone marrow samples of 3 randomly selected healthy human donors were intravenously administered. sEVs obtained from normoxic and hypoxic MSCs were applied. PMNs were depleted in vehicle and MSC-sEV-treated mice. Neurological deficits, ischemic injury, blood-brain barrier integrity, peripheral blood leukocyte responses, and brain leukocyte infiltration were evaluated over 72 hours. Results- sEV preparations of all 3 donors collected from normoxic MSCs significantly reduced neurological deficits. Preparations of 2 of these donors significantly decreased infarct volume and neuronal injury. sEV-induced neuroprotection was consistently associated with a decreased brain infiltration of leukocytes, namely of PMNs, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes. sEVs obtained from hypoxic MSCs (1% O2) had similar effects on neurological deficits and ischemic injury as MSC-sEVs obtained under regular conditions (21% O2) but also reduced serum IgG extravasation-a marker of blood-brain barrier permeability. PMN depletion mimicked the effects of MSC-sEVs on neurological recovery, ischemic injury, and brain PMN, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. Combined MSC-sEV administration and PMN depletion did not have any effects superior to PMN depletion in any of the readouts examined. Conclusions- Leukocytes and specifically PMNs contribute to MSC-sEV-induced ischemic neuroprotection. Individual MSC-sEV preparations may differ in their neuroprotective activities. Potency assays are urgently needed to identify their therapeutic efficacy before clinical application. Visual Overview- An online visual overview is available for this article.",

An important aspect of MSC-mediated therapeutic activities is immune modulation. Consistent with the concentration of MSC therapeutic potency in its secretion, a significant proportion of MSC immune potency resides in the small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) secreted by MSCs. These sEVs, which also include exosomes, carry a large cargo enriched in proteins with potent immunomodulatory activities. They have been reported to exert potent effects on humoral and cellular components of the immune system in vitro and in vivo, and may have the potential to support the diametrically opposite pro- and anti-inflammatory functions necessary for tissue repair and regeneration following injury. Following injury, pro-inflammatory activities are necessary to neutralize injury and remove dead or injured tissue, while anti-inflammatory activities to facilitate migration and proliferation of reparative cell types and to increase vascularization and nutrient supply are necessary to repair and regenerate new tissue. Therefore, a critical immunomodulatory requisite of MSC sEVs in tissue regeneration is the capacity to support the appropriate immune activities at the appropriate time. Here, we review how some of the immune regulatory targets of MSC sEVs could support the dynamic immunomodulatory activities during tissue repair and regeneration.",

In particular, we have focused on recapitulating endocrine cell clustering by isolating and reaggregating immature β-like cells to form islet-sized enriched β-clusters (eBCs). eBCs display physiological properties analogous to primary human β cells, including robust dynamic insulin secretion, increased calcium signalling in response to secretagogues, and improved mitochondrial energization. Notably, endocrine cell clustering induces metabolic maturation by driving mitochondrial oxidative respiration, a process central to stimulus-secretion coupling in mature β cells. eBCs display glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as early as three days after transplantation in mice.

ILCs also had cellular insulin contents similar to or higher than human foetal islets. Expression of islet and pancreas-specific cell markers was maintained for 70 days post-transplantation. The mean survival of recipients was increased by transplanted ILCs as compared to transplanted human fibroblast cells (P < 0.0001), or undifferentiated hESCs (P < 0.042). Graft function was confirmed by secretion of human C-peptide in response to an oral bolus of glucose.\n\nConclusions: hESC-derived ILC grafts continued to contain cells that were positive for islet endocrine hormones and were shown to be functional by their ability to secrete human C-peptide.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a high percentage of c-peptide positive cells in the derivation.

However, their differentiation in vitro is still inefficient, and functional studies reveal that most of these β-like cells still fail to fully mirror the adult β-cell physiology. For their proper growth and functioning, β-cells require a very specific environment, the islet niche, which provides a myriad of chemical and physical signals. While the nature and effects of chemical stimuli have been widely characterized, less is known about the mechanical signals. We here review the current status of knowledge of biophysical cues provided by the niche where β-cells normally live and differentiate, and we underline the possible machinery designated for mechanotransduction in β-cells. Although the regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood, the analysis reveals that β-cells are equipped with all mechanosensors and signaling proteins actively involved in mechanotransduction in other cell types, and they respond to mechanical cues by changing their behavior.

        "abstract": "The minimal structural unit of a solid tumor is a single cell or a cellular compartment such as the nucleus. A closer look inside the cells reveals that there are functional compartments or even structural domains determining the overall properties of a cell such as the mechanical phenotype. The mechanical interaction of these living cells leads to the complex organization such as compartments, tissues and organs of organisms including mammals. In contrast to passive non-living materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical perturbations occurring in their microenvironment during diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. The transformation of single cancer cells in highly aggressive and hence malignant cancer cells during malignant cancer progression encompasses the basement membrane crossing, the invasion of connective tissue, the stroma microenvironments and transbarrier migration, which all require the immediate interaction of the aggressive and invasive cancer cells with the surrounding extracellular matrix environment including normal embedded neighboring cells. All these steps of the metastatic pathway seem to involve mechanical interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. The pathology of cancer due to a broad heterogeneity of cancer types is still not fully understood. Hence it is necessary to reveal the signaling pathways such as mechanotransduction pathways that seem to be commonly involved in the development and establishment of the metastatic and mechanical phenotype in several carcinoma cells. We still do not know whether there exist distinct metastatic genes regulating the progression of tumors. These metastatic genes may then be activated either during the progression of cancer by themselves on their migration path or in earlier stages of oncogenesis through activated oncogenes or inactivated tumor suppressor genes, both of which promote the metastatic phenotype. In more detail, the adhesion of cancer cells to their surrounding stroma induces the generation of intracellular contraction forces that deform their microenvironments by alignment of fibers. The amplitude of these forces can adapt to the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. Moreover, the adhesion strength of cancer cells seems to determine whether a cancer cell is able to migrate through connective tissue or across barriers such as the basement membrane or endothelial cell linings of blood or lymph vessels in order to metastasize. In turn, exposure of adherent cancer cells to physical forces, such as shear flow in vessels or compression forces around tumors, reinforces cell adhesion, regulates cell contractility and restructures the ordering of the local stroma matrix that leads subsequently to secretion of crosslinking proteins or matrix degrading enzymes. Hence invasive cancer cells alter the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. From a mechanobiological point-of-view, the recognized physical signals are transduced into biochemical signaling events that guide cellular responses such as cancer progression after the malignant transition of cancer cells from an epithelial and non-motile phenotype to a mesenchymal and motile (invasive) phenotype providing cellular motility. This transition can also be described as the physical attempt to relate this cancer cell transitional behavior to a T1 phase transition such as the jamming to unjamming transition. During the invasion of cancer cells, cell adaptation occurs to mechanical alterations of the local stroma, such as enhanced stroma upon fibrosis, and therefore we need to uncover underlying mechano-coupling and mechano-regulating functional processes that reinforce the invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, these mechanisms may also be responsible for the awakening of dormant residual cancer cells within the microenvironment. Physicists were initially tempted to consider the steps of the cancer metastasis cascade as single events caused by a single mechanical alteration of the overall properties of the cancer cell. However, this general and simple view has been challenged by the finding that several mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment influence each other and continuously contribute to tumor growth and cancer progression. In addition, basement membrane crossing, cell invasion and transbarrier migration during cancer progression is explained in physical terms by applying physical principles on living cells regardless of their complexity and individual differences of cancer types. As a novel approach, the impact of the individual microenvironment surrounding cancer cells is also included. Moreover, new theories and models are still needed to understand why certain cancers are malignant and aggressive, while others stay still benign. However, due to the broad variety of cancer types, there may be various pathways solely suitable for specific cancer types and distinct steps in the process of cancer progression. In this review, physical concepts and hypotheses of cancer initiation and progression including cancer cell basement membrane crossing, invasion and transbarrier migration are presented and discussed from a biophysical point-of-view. In addition, the crosstalk between cancer cells and a chronically altered microenvironment, such as fibrosis, is discussed including the basic physical concepts of fibrosis and the cellular responses to mechanical stress caused by the mechanically altered microenvironment. Here, is highlighted how biophysical approaches, both experimentally and theoretically, have an impact on classical hallmarks of cancer and fibrosis and how they contribute to the understanding of the regulation of cancer and its progression by sensing and responding to the physical environmental properties through mechanotransduction processes. Finally, this review discusses various physical models of cell migration such as blebbing, nuclear piston, protrusive force and unjamming transition migration modes and how they contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, these cellular migration modes are influenced by microenvironmental perturbances such as fibrosis that can induce mechanical alterations in cancer cells, which in turn may impact the environment. Hence, the classical hallmarks of cancer need to be refined by including biomechanical properties of cells, cell clusters and tissues and their microenvironment to understand mechano-regulatory processes within cancer cells and the entire organism.",

        "abstract": "The migration and invasion of cancer cells through 3D confined extracellular matrices is coupled to cell mechanics and the mechanics of the extracellular matrix. Cell mechanics is mainly determined by both the mechanics of the largest organelle in the cell, the nucleus, and the cytoskeletal architecture of the cell. Hence, cytoskeletal and nuclear mechanics are the major contributors to cell mechanics. Among other factors, steric hindrances of the extracellular matrix confinement are supposed to affect nuclear mechanics and thus also influence cell mechanics. Therefore, we propose that the percentage of invasive cells and their invasion depths into loose and dense 3D extracellular matrices is regulated by both nuclear and cytoskeletal mechanics. In order to investigate the effect of both nuclear and cytoskeletal mechanics on the overall cell mechanics, we firstly altered nuclear mechanics by the chromatin de-condensing reagent Trichostatin A (TSA) and secondly altered cytoskeletal mechanics by addition of actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin A and the myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin. In fact, we found that TSA-treated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells increased their invasion depth in dense 3D extracellular matrices, whereas the invasion depths in loose matrices were decreased. Similarly, the invasion depths of TSA-treated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in dense matrices were significantly increased compared to loose matrices, where the invasion depths were decreased. These results are also valid in the presence of a matrix-metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that the nuclear stiffnesses of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were pronouncedly higher than their cytoskeletal stiffness, whereas the stiffness of the nucleus of human mammary epithelial cells was decreased compared to their cytoskeleton. TSA treatment reduced cytoskeletal and nuclear stiffness of MCF-7 cells, as expected. However, a softening of the nucleus by TSA treatment may induce a stiffening of the cytoskeleton of MDA-MB-231 cells and subsequently an apparent stiffening of the nucleus. Inhibiting actin polymerization using Latrunculin A revealed a softer nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells under TSA treatment. This indicates that the actin-dependent cytoskeletal stiffness seems to be influenced by the TSA-induced nuclear stiffness changes. Finally, the combined treatment with TSA and Latrunculin A further justifies the hypothesis of apparent nuclear stiffening, indicating that cytoskeletal mechanics seem to be regulated by nuclear mechanics.",

We have established a magnetic tweezer that is capable of measuring the linear and non-linear viscoelastic behavior of a wide range of soft matter in precisely controlled environmental conditions, such as temperature, CO2 and humidity. The magnetic tweezer presented in this study is suitable to detect specific differences in the mechanical properties of different cell lines, such as human breast cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as well as collagen matrices of distinct concentrations in the presence and absence of fibronectin crosslinks. The precise calibration and control mechanism employed in the presented magnetic tweezer setup provides the ability to apply physiological force up to 5 nN on 4.5 µm superparamagnetic beads coated with fibronectin and coupled to the cells or collagen matrices. These measurements reveal specific local linear and non-linear viscoelastic behavior of the investigated samples. The viscoelastic response of cells and collagen matrices to the force application is best described by a weak power law behavior. Our results demonstrate that the stress stiffening response and the fluidization of cells is cell type specific and varies largely between differently invasive and aggressive cancer cells. Finally, we showed that the viscoelastic behavior of collagen matrices with and without fibronectin crosslinks measured by the magnetic tweezer can be related to the microstructure of these matrices.",

        "title": "Fibril bending stiffness of 3D collagen matrices instructs spreading and clustering of invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cells",
        "abstract": "Extracellular matrix stiffening of breast tissues has been clinically correlated with malignant transformation and poor prognosis. An increase of collagen fibril diameter and lysyl-oxidase mediated crosslinking has been observed in advanced tumor stages. Many current reports suggest that the local mechanical properties of single fibrillar components dominantly regulate cancer cell behavior. Here, we demonstrate by an independent control of fibril diameter and intrafibrillar crosslinking of three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrices that fibril bending stiffness instructs cell behavior of invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cells. Two types of collagen matrices with fibril diameter of either 650 nm or 800 nm at a similar pore size of 10 μm were reconstituted and further modified with the zero-length crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) at concentrations of 0, 20, 100 and 500 mM. This approach yields two sets of collagen matrices with overlapping variation of matrix elasticity. With these matrices we could prove the common assumption that matrix elasticity of collagen networks is bending dominated with a linear dependence on fibril bending stiffness. We derive that the measured variation of matrix elasticity is directly correlated to the variation of fibril bending stiffness, being independently controlled either by fibril diameter or by intrafibrillar crosslinking. We use these defined matrices to demonstrate that the adjustment of fibril bending stiffness allows to instruct the behavior of two different breast cancer cell lines, invasive MDA-MB-231 (human breast carcinoma) and non-invasive MCF-7 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma). Invasiveness and spreading of invasive MDA-MB-231 cells as well as clustering of non-invasive MCF-7 cells is thereby investigated over a broad parameter range. Our results demonstrate and quantify the direct dependence of cancer cell phenotypes on the matrix mechanical properties on the scale of single fibrils.",

        "abstract": "Scaffolds for tissue engineering application may be made from a collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissues because the ECM can mimic the functions of the target tissue. The primary sources of collagenous ECM material are calf skin and bone. However, these sources are associated with the risk of having bovine spongiform encephalopathy or transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Alternative sources for collagenous ECM materials may be derived from livestock, e.g., pigs, and from marine animals, e.g., sea urchins. Collagenous ECM of the sea urchin possesses structural features and mechanical properties that are similar to those of mammalian ones. However, even more intriguing is that some tissues such as the ligamentous catch apparatus can exhibit mutability, namely rapid reversible changes in the tissue mechanical properties. These tissues are known as mutable collagenous tissues (MCTs). The mutability of these tissues has been the subject of on-going investigations, covering the biochemistry, structural biology and mechanical properties of the collagenous components. Recent studies point to a nerve-control system for regulating the ECM macromolecules that are involved in the sliding action of collagen fibrils in the MCT. This review discusses the key attributes of the structure and function of the ECM of the sea urchin ligaments that are related to the fibril-fibril sliding action-the focus is on the respective components within the hierarchical architecture of the tissue. In this context, structure refers to size, shape and separation distance of the ECM components while function is associated with mechanical properties e.g., strength and stiffness. For simplicity, the components that address the different length scale from the largest to the smallest are as follows: collagen fibres, collagen fibrils, interfibrillar matrix and collagen molecules. Application of recent theories of stress transfer and fracture mechanisms in fibre reinforced composites to a wide variety of collagen reinforcing (non-mutable) connective tissue, has allowed us to draw general conclusions concerning the mechanical response of the MCT at specific mechanical states, namely the stiff and complaint states. The intent of this review is to provide the latest insights, as well as identify technical challenges and opportunities, that may be useful for developing methods for effective mechanical support when adapting decellularised connective tissues from the sea urchin for tissue engineering or for the design of a synthetic analogue.",

Although there is some literature assessing the general chemical features and biocompatibility of collagen extracts from marine sponges, no data are available on the biological effects of sponge collagen hydrolysates for biomedical and/or cosmetic purposes. Here, we studied the in vitro toxicity, antioxidant, wound-healing, and photoprotective properties of four HPLC-purified fractions of trypsin-digested collagen extracts-marine collagen hydrolysates (MCHs)-from the marine sponge C. reniformis. The results showed that the four MCHs have no degree of toxicity on the cell lines analyzed; conversely, they were able to stimulate cell growth. They showed a significant antioxidant activity both in cell-free assays as well as in H₂O₂ or quartz-stimulated macrophages, going from 23% to 60% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity for the four MCHs. Finally, an in vitro wound-healing test was performed with fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and the survival of both cells was evaluated after UV radiation. In both experiments, MCHs showed significant results, increasing the proliferation speed and protecting from UV-induced cell death. Overall, these data open the way to the use of C. reniformis MCHs in drug and cosmetic formulations for damaged or photoaged skin repair.",

One promising candidate for biomedical applications is the collagen extracted from the marine sponge Chondrosia reniformis, because of its biocompatibility and because is devoid of the health risks associated with bovine and porcine collagens. Here we report on the production and selection, by enzymatic and biomolecular analyses, of a triple transformed Pichia pastoris strain expressing a stable P4H tetramer derived from C. reniformis sponge and a hydroxylated non fibrillar procollagen polypeptide from the same animal. The percentage of recombinant procollagen hydroxylated prolines inside the transformed yeast was of 36.3% analyzed by mass spectrometry indicating that the recombinant enzyme is active on its natural substrate inside the yeast cell host. Furthermore, the recombinant sponge P4H has the ability to hydroxylate its natural substrate in both X and Y positions in the Xaa-Yaa-Gly collagenous triplets.

Recombinant collagen is different from natural collagen in its hydroxyproline (Hyp) content and thermal stability. To obtain hydroxylated collagen for applications in biomedicine and biomaterials, the human collagen α1(III) chain was co-expressed with the viral prolyl 4-hydroxylase A085R in Escherichia coli. Unlike previous reports using human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, this study examined the hydroxylation of full-length human collagen α1(III) chain (COL3A1) by viral prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The genes encoding these two proteins were controlled by different promoters, Ptac and PRPL, on a recombinant pKK223-3 plasmid. The sequencing results verified that the target genes were successfully inserted into the recombinant vector. Based on quantitative PCR, SDS-PAGE, and western blotting, successful expression by E. coli BL21(DE3) was detected at the mRNA and protein levels for both loci. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results suggested that the highest Hyp yield was obtained when the two proteins were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and heat-shock treatment at 50 °C, corresponding to high enzyme expression and low human collagen α1(III) chain expression levels. A biological activity analysis indicated that the recombinant collagen with the highest hydroxylation level supported the growth of baby hamster kidney cells, similar to observations for native collagen. The production of hydroxylated collagen in this study establishes a new method for collagen hydroxylation and provides a basis for the application of recombinant collagen expressed in E. coli.",

        "abstract": "Understanding cell fate specification is particularly useful because it enables biologists to generate specific neural cell types for treating currently untreatable neurological diseases. Traditionally, lineage-specific progenitors are generated in vitro from pluripotent cells, after which they may be channeled into more mature cell types in a stage-specific manner, which is similar to the way cells behave during development. However, the emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells means that specific cell types can be generated directly from fibroblasts or other somatic cell types, thus bypassing all of the necessary steps that happen in vivo. Based on this information, the present review first explores the regulatory circuitry that drives cell fate specification over time in vivo. In particular, it describes how the appearance of specific neuronal and glial cell types is governed by an intrinsic biological clock, followed by a discussion of how this can be achieved through the temporal expression of intracellular regulators in relation to cell-specific Dnase I hypersensitivity sites, promoters and enhancers. Cell fate acquisition in vitro was then examined in an attempt to evaluate whether the temporal regulation neural cell fate in vivo is still relevant to the generation of reprogrammed neural stem cells and neurons.

Stem cells provide the possibility of a potential treatment for POF. In this study, rat embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were co-cultured with granulosa cells (GCs) to differentiate to GC-like cells. The level of estradiol (E2) analyzed by radioimmunoassay showed that the E2 concentration of the culture supernatant of co-cultured rat iPSCs and ESCs increased in a time-dependent manner, compared with the GCs group that has an opposite trend. The expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) was confirmed by immunostaining. These results indicated that rat iPSCs and ESCs were effectively induced to GC-like cells through indirect cell-to-cell contact. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the expression level of marker genes in POF, including BMP15, FMR1, FSHR, INHA, AMH, NOBOX, FOXO3, EIF2B, FIGLA, and GDF9.

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, genetic basis of premature ovarian failure (POF) and ovarian cancer still remains elusive. It is indeed paradoxical that scientists searched for mutations in FSH receptor (FSHR) expressed on granulosa cells, whereas more than 90% of cancers arise in ovary surface epithelium (OSE). Two distinct populations of stem cells including very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and ovarian stem cells (OSCs) exist in OSE, are responsible for neo-oogenesis and primordial follicle assembly in adult life, and are modulated by FSH via its alternatively spliced receptor variant FSHR3 (growth factor type 1 receptor acting via calcium signaling and the ERK/MAPK pathway). Any defect in FSH-FSHR3-stem cell interaction in OSE may affect folliculogenesis and thus result in POF. Ovarian aging is associated with a compromised microenvironment that does not support stem cell differentiation into oocytes and further folliculogenesis. FSH exerts a mitogenic effect on OSE and elevated FSH levels associated with advanced age may provide a continuous trigger for stem cells to proliferate resulting in cancer, thus supporting gonadotropin theory for ovarian cancer. Present review is an attempt to put adult ovarian biology, POF, aging, and cancer in the perspective of FSH-FSHR3-stem cell network that functions in OSE. This hypothesis is further supported by the recent understanding that: i) cancer is a stem cell disease and OSE is the niche for ovarian cancer stem cells; ii) ovarian OCT4-positive stem cells are regulated by FSH; and iii) OCT4 along with LIN28 and BMP4 are highly expressed in ovarian cancers.",

        "abstract": "The ability of gonadotropins to act on and regulate normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells and ovarian cancer cells was investigated. Bovine OSE was used as a model to study normal OSE. Results demonstrate that follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and the luteinizing hormone (LH) like molecule, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), can both stimulate (3H)-thymidine incorporation into DNA in normal OSE cells. Similar results were obtained using either purified hormones or recombinant human hormones. A human ovarian cancer cell-line OCC1 was also stimulated to grow in response to FSH and hCG, but the growth of a different human ovarian cancer cell-line SKOV3 was not affected. In addition to effects on cell growth, gonadotropins also stimulated growth factor expression. Both FSH and hCG stimulated steady state levels of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and kit ligand (KL) mRNA in OSE cells. Previously, KGF, HGF, and KL have been shown to stimulate OSE growth. Both follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) were observed in OSE cells by Northern blot analysis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on fresh and cultured OSE cells. Normal OSE was found to express FSHR and LHR both in vivo and in vitro. The PCR reaction products were sequenced and found to provide a 100% homology with the bovine gonadotropin receptor sequences previously reported. FSHR and LHR transcripts were also detected in gonadotropin responsive OCC1 cells, but not in the gonadotropin insensitive SKOV3 cells. Observations support the hypothesis that gonadotropins may influence some ovarian cancers. In summary, the current study demonstrates the novel observation that both the FSHR and LHR are expressed by bovine OSE and selected ovarian cancers. Interestingly, the actions of FSH and LH to promote OSE growth may in part be mediated indirectly through an elevation in the expression of autocrine growth factors (KGF, HGF, and KL). Ovarian cancer is more common in conditions with elevated gonadotropins such as post-menopausal women. Therefore, gonadotropin actions on the OSE are postulated to be a potential factor in the onset and progression of some ovarian cancers.",

Meta-analysis was performed when three or more studies reported genetic data on the same polymorphism or mutation. Additive and dominant models were analyzed using RevMan Version 5.1.\n\nResults: The literature search yielded 575 articles, of which 59 studies on the association between POF and gene variants were identified for meta-analysis. Five genes were selected for analysis, including 10 common gene polymorphisms [BMP15 (-9C>G, 788insTCT and 852C>T), ESR1 (-351A>G and -397C>T), FMR1 CGG repeat, FSHR (919A>G and 2039A>G), INHA (-16C>T and -124A>G)] and two mutations (BMP15 538G>A and INHA 769G>A). BMP15 538G>A was found to be significantly more common in patients with POF compared with controls. No significant associations were found between the other variants of BMP15 and POF. With respect to ESR1, the accumulative results were not significant, although the findings of the individual studies were controversial. The incidence of FMR1 premutation was significantly higher in patients with POF compared with controls [odds ratio (OR) 9.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.42-15.61; p<0.001] in the overall population, as well as in both Caucasian and Asian subgroups.

No significant associations were found between the other variants of INHA and POF.\n\nConclusions: BMP15 538A, FMR1 premutation and INHA 769A (in Asians alone) may indicate susceptibility to POF.

The aim of this research is to investigate the mechanisms of hPMSCs on ovarian reserve capacity.\n\nMethods: The POF mice model was established by injection of zona pellucida 3 peptide (pZP3). hPMSC transplantation was conducted by intravenous injection into mice following pZP3 treatment. The follicle number was examined by histopathology. The serum levels of FSH, LH, E2, AMH and anti-zona pellucida antibody (AzpAb) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AMH and FSHR expression in the ovary was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Granulosa cell apoptosis of the ovaries was examined by In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit. Granulosa cells were isolated and treated with SiAmh interference and hPMSC supernatant to observe the effects of AMH expression on granulosa cell apoptosis in vitro.\n\nResults: The results showed that hPMSC transplantation can significantly recover the estrus cycle in the POF group. Morphological staining showed that the basal follicles and sinus follicles after hPMSC transplantation were higher in POF mice than in those without treatment, and the follicle number was significantly decreased with atresia. The serum levels of FSH, LH and AzpAb in the hPMSC transplantation group were reduced considerably, but the E2 and AMH levels were significantly increased. After hPMSC transplantation, the AMH and FSHR expression in ovarian tissue was significantly higher than in the POF group as determined by immunochemistry and western blot analysis. The FSHR expression was shown in granulosa cells only, and FSHR expression increases with AMH expressed in the ovary; granulosa cell apoptosis was decreased following hPMSC transplantation. The same results were observed from the in-vitro study.\n\nConclusions: hPMSC transplantation can significantly improve the serum levels of high gonadotropin and low estrogen of POF mice, promote follicular development, inhibit excessive follicular atresia and granulosa cell apoptosis, and improve the ovarian reserve capacity. The mechanism may be achieved by increasing the expression of AMH and FSHR in ovaries.",

However, the interactions between these four players is not fully understood.\n\nObjectives and rationale: The purpose of this review is to highlight the chronological sequence of the appearance and function of androgens, FSH, AMH and E2 and to discuss controversies in the relationship between FSH and AMH. A better understanding of this interaction could supplement our current knowledge about the pathophysiology of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nSearch methods: A literature review was performed using the following search terms: androgens, FSH, FSH receptor, anti-Mullerian hormone, AMHRII, estradiol, follicle, ovary, PCOS, aromatase, granulosa cell, oocyte. The time period searched was 1980-2015 and the databases interrogated were PubMed and Web of Science.\n\nOutcomes: During the pre-antral ('gonadotropin-independent') follicle growth, FSH is already active and promotes follicle growth in synergy with theca cell-derived androgens. Conversely, AMH is inhibitory by counteracting FSH. We challenge the hypothesis that AMH is regulated by androgens and propose rather an indirect effect through an androgen-dependent amplification of FSH action on granulosa cells (GCs) from small growing follicles. This hypothesis implies that FSH stimulates AMH expression. During the antral ('gonadotropin-dependent') follicle growth, E2 production results from FSH-dependent activation of aromatase. Conversely, AMH is inhibitory but the decline of its expression, amplified by E2, allows full expression of aromatase, characteristic of the large antral follicles. We propose a theoretical scheme made up of two triangles that follow each other chronologically. In PCOS, pre-antral follicle growth is excessive (triangle 1) because of intrinsic androgen excess that renders GCs hypersensitive to FSH, with consequently excessive AMH expression. Antral follicle growth and differentiation are disturbed (triangle 2) because of the abnormally persisting inhibition of FSH effects by AMH that blocks aromatase. Beside anovulation, this scenario may also serve to explain the higher receptiveness to gonadotropin therapy and the increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in patients with PCOS.\n\nWider implications: Within GCs, the balance between FSH and AMH effects is pivotal in the shift from androgen- to oestrogen-driven follicles. Our two triangles hypothesis, based on updated data from the literature, offers a pedagogic template for the understanding of folliculogenesis in the normal and polycystic ovary. It opens new avenues for the treatment of anovulation due to PCOS.\n\nKeywords: FSH; PCOS; androgens; anti-Müllerian hormone; estradiol; folliculogenesis; granulosa cell.",

We determined the progeny of single SVZ-NPCs, the number of cells per clone, the dispersion of sibling cells, and the cell types within clones. Long-term analysis revealed that both the cell-dispersion pattern and number of cells comprising clones varied depending on the glial/neuronal nature of sibling cells. Sibling-olfactory interneurons were primarily located within the same layer, while sibling-glial cells populated SVZ-adjacent areas. Sibling astrocytes and interneurons did not form big clones, whereas oligodendroglial-lineage clones comprised the largest clones originated in adult brains.

Therefore, we used replication deficient retroviral vectors to analyze the clonal progeny of single rat SVZ cells that were maintained in culture media permissive or non-permissive for neuronal differentiation. When maintained in medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, all surviving progenitors generated glial cell clones. Within these glial clones we often observed both type 1 astrocytes and O-2A lineage cells. When SVZ cells were maintained in medium permissive for neurogenesis approximately 50% of the total clones contained at least one antigenically defined neuron. Of those clones that contained neurons, 60% contained neurons and glia. The other 50% of the total clones were either comprised of only astrocytes, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, or were unidentifiable. Since the culture environment permitted multilineage clone formation, yet many homogeneous neuronal or astrocytic clones were obtained, some progenitors must become developmentally restricted while they are in the germinal zone. Therefore, we conclude that the perinatal SVZ is a mosaic of multipotential, bipotential, and lineage restricted precursors, and that the lack of postnatal neocortical neurogenesis is not due to the absence of potential neuroblasts.",

        "abstract": "What precursor cells are the source of the macroglia generated during postnatal development? In order to answer this question, we studied the expression of glial specific antigens in proliferating neuroglia in postnatal rodent brain and optic nerve. Immunocytochemistry using antibodies to oligodendrocyte (OL) specific markers (sulfatide and galactocerebroside) and an astrocyte (AS) specific marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein) was combined with thymidine autoradiography. During the first week of postnatal development when most ASs are being generated, one third to one half of the proliferating cells in the optic system are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein after a 1 h injection of thymidine (Skoff, Dev. Biol., 139:149-168, 1990). During the second postnatal week when OLs are being generated, 30 to 100% of the proliferating cells in presumptive white matter tracts are sulfatide positive and at least 10% are galactocerebroside positive. This finding demonstrates that ASs and OLs divide during postnatal development. These results confirm previous electron microscopic autoradiographic studies showing that the vast majority of proliferating cells in postnatal rat optic nerve have the morphologic characteristics of differentiating ASs or OLs (Skoff, J. Comp. Neurol., 169:291-312, 1976). Since proliferating ASs (astroblasts) and OLs (oligodendroblasts) constitute the majority of the dividing cells at the time that ASs and OLs are being generated, these glioblasts must be the major source for the macroglia generated postnatally. The findings strongly suggest that separate lineages exist for ASs and OLs during postnatal development. There is no compelling in vivo evidence for a bipotential progenitor cell that generates the majority of OLs and certain ASs in postnatal rodent brain. There may, of course, be distinct lineages for the subtypes of ASs and possibly even for subtypes of OLs. We review the concepts of commitment and plasticity and apply these terms to glial differentiation. In situ, the presence of oligodendroblasts and astroblasts demonstrates the COMMITMENT of proliferating cells to a specific glial lineage during normal development. Culture conditions may provide an environment that permits proliferating glial cells to vacillate in their selection of a specific lineage. This situation demonstrates developmental PLASTICITY and the ability of glia to adapt to an altered environment. Whether committed glial cells in situ can be induced to switch their lineage when normal CNS conditions are altered is an intriguing question that remains to be answered.",

        "abstract": "The inhibition of differentiation of oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitors into oligodendrocytes caused by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can be overcome by non-O-2A lineage cells present in the optic nerve and by astrocytes purified from cerebral cortices. Although purified O-2A progenitors grown in the presence of bFGF for up to 6 days were inhibited from differentiating into oligodendrocytes, O-2A progenitors growing in heterogeneous optic nerve cultures did not show a similar inhibition of differentiation. The factor(s) responsible for overriding the inhibitory effects of bFGF appeared to be secreted by astrocytes, as extensive generation of oligodendrocytes was seen in cultures of purified O-2A progenitors exposed to bFGF+ medium conditioned by purified astrocytes (ACM). In addition, purified O-2A progenitors displayed a remarkable sensitivity to bFGF, which extended at least down to concentrations of 0.03 ng/ml, a concentration of < 2 x 10(-12) M. At a bFGF concentration of just 0.1 ng/ml, this mitogen still promoted DNA synthesis in as many O-2A progenitors as in cultures exposed to 1-30 ng/ml of this growth factor, but exhibited a reduced ability to promote DNA synthesis in oligodendrocytes. In addition, although concentrations of bFGF as low as 0.03 ng/ml were a potent stimulator of DNA synthesis in O-2A progenitors, application of this amount of bFGF no longer inhibited the differentiation of progenitors into oligodendrocytes as effectively as application of higher bFGF concentrations. Thus, the induction of DNA synthesis by bFGF can be uncoupled from the inhibition of differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "For over 100 years, endosymbiotic theories have figured in thoughts about the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed mitochondria had the bioenergetic means to attain eukaryotic cell complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of endosymbiotic theory have it that the host was an archaeon (an archaebacterium), not a eukaryote. Hence the evolutionary history and biology of archaea increasingly comes to bear on eukaryotic origins, more than ever before. Here, we have compiled a survey of endosymbiotic theories for the origin of eukaryotes and mitochondria, and for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus, summarizing the essentials of each and contrasting some of their predictions to the observations. A new aspect of endosymbiosis in eukaryote evolution comes into focus from these considerations: the host for the origin of plastids was a facultative anaerobe.",

        "abstract": "Endosymbiotic theory in eukaryotic-cell evolution rests upon a foundation of three cornerstone partners--the plastid (a cyanobacterium), the mitochondrion (a proteobacterium), and its host (an archaeon)--and carries a corollary that, over time, the majority of genes once present in the organelle genomes were relinquished to the chromosomes of the host (endosymbiotic gene transfer). However, notwithstanding eukaryote-specific gene inventions, single-gene phylogenies have never traced eukaryotic genes to three single prokaryotic sources, an issue that hinges crucially upon factors influencing phylogenetic inference. In the age of genomes, single-gene trees, once used to test the predictions of endosymbiotic theory, now spawn new theories that stand to eventually replace endosymbiotic theory with descriptive, gene tree-based variants featuring supernumerary symbionts: prokaryotic partners distinct from the cornerstone trio and whose existence is inferred solely from single-gene trees. We reason that the endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts brought into the eukaryotic--and plant and algal--lineage a genome-sized sample of genes from the proteobacterial and cyanobacterial pangenomes of their respective day and that, even if molecular phylogeny were artifact-free, sampling prokaryotic pangenomes through endosymbiotic gene transfer would lead to inherited chimerism. Recombination in prokaryotes (transduction, conjugation, transformation) differs from recombination in eukaryotes (sex). Prokaryotic recombination leads to pangenomes, and eukaryotic recombination leads to vertical inheritance. Viewed from the perspective of endosymbiotic theory, the critical transition at the eukaryote origin that allowed escape from Muller's ratchet--the origin of eukaryotic recombination, or sex--might have required surprisingly little evolutionary innovation.",

Eukaryotes do acquire genes from mitochondria and plastids and they do transfer genes during the process of secondary endosymbiosis, the spread of plastids via eukaryotic algal endosymbionts. From those observations it, however, does not follow that eukaryotes transfer genes either in the same ways as prokaryotes do, or to a quantitatively similar degree. An important illustration of the difference is that eukaryotes do not exhibit pangenomes, though prokaryotes do. Eukaryotes reveal no detectable cumulative effects of LGT, though prokaryotes do.

        "abstract": "Background: The literature harbors many claims for lateral gene transfer (LGT) from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Such claims are typically founded in analyses of genome sequences. It is undisputed that many genes entered the eukaryotic lineage via the origin of mitochondria and the origin of plastids. Claims for lineage-specific LGT to eukaryotes outside the context of organelle origins and claims of continuous LGT to eukaryotic lineages are more problematic. If eukaryotes acquire genes from prokaryotes continuously during evolution, then sequenced eukaryote genomes should harbor evidence for recent LGT, like prokaryotic genomes do.\n\nResults: Here we devise an approach to investigate 30,358 eukaryotic sequences in the context of 1,035,375 prokaryotic homologs among 2585 phylogenetic trees containing homologs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryote genomes reflect a continuous process of gene acquisition and inheritance, with abundant recent acquisitions showing 80-100 % amino acid sequence identity to their phylogenetic sister-group homologs from other phyla. By contrast, eukaryote genomes show no evidence for either continuous or recent gene acquisitions from prokaryotes. We find that, in general, genes in eukaryotic genomes that share ≥70 % amino acid identity to prokaryotic homologs are genome-specific; that is, they are not found outside individual genome assemblies.\n\nConclusions: Our analyses indicate that eukaryotes do not acquire genes through continual LGT like prokaryotes do. We propose a 70 % rule: Coding sequences in eukaryotic genomes that share more than 70 % amino acid sequence identity to prokaryotic homologs are most likely assembly or annotation artifacts. The findings further uncover that the role of differential loss in eukaryote genome evolution has been vastly underestimated.",

        "abstract": "Lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays a major role in prokaryote evolution with only a few genes that are resistant to it; yet the nature and magnitude of barriers to lateral transfer are still debated. Here, we implement directed networks to investigate donor-recipient events of recent lateral gene transfer among 657 sequenced prokaryote genomes. For 2,129,548 genes investigated, we detected 446,854 recent lateral gene transfer events through nucleotide pattern analysis. Among these, donor-recipient relationships could be specified through phylogenetic reconstruction for 7% of the pairs, yielding 32,028 polarized recent gene acquisition events, which constitute the edges of our directed networks. We find that the frequency of recent LGT is linearly correlated both with genome sequence similarity and with proteome similarity of donor-recipient pairs. Genome sequence similarity accounts for 25% of the variation in gene-transfer frequency, with proteome similarity adding only 1% to the variability explained. The range of donor-recipient GC content similarity within the network is extremely narrow, with 86% of the LGTs occurring between donor-recipient pairs having ≤5% difference in GC content. Hence, genome sequence similarity and GC content similarity are strong barriers to LGT in prokaryotes. But they are not insurmountable, as we detected 1530 recent transfers between distantly related genomes. The directed network revealed that recipient genomes of distant transfers encode proteins of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; a DNA repair mechanism) far more frequently than the recipient lacking that mechanism. This implicates NHEJ in genes spread across distantly related prokaryotes through bypassing the donor-recipient sequence similarity barrier.",

A novel glucosyltransferase UGT74AF3a and its allelic protein UGT74AF3b specifically catalyzed the glucosylation of HDMF and the commercially important structural homologues 2 (or 5)-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5 (or 2)-methylfuran-3(2H)-one (EHMF) and 4-hydroxy-5-methylfuran-3(2H)-one (HMF) to their corresponding β-D-glucosides.

The accumulation of HDMF glucoside was consistent with the transcript levels of UGT74AF3 in different tea cultivars. In addition, transient UGT74AF3a overexpression in tobacco significantly increased the HDMF glucoside contents, and downregulation of UGT74AF3 transcripts in tea leaves significantly reduced the concentration of HDMF glucoside compared with the levels in the controls.

Mitophagy also mediates removal of mitochondria from developing erythrocytes, and contributes to maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA through the elimination of sperm-derived mitochondria. Recent studies have identified specific regulators of mitophagy that ensure selective sequestration of mitochondria as cargo. In yeast, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein autophagy-related gene 32 (ATG32) recruits the autophagic machinery to mitochondria, while mammalian Nix is required for degradation of erythrocyte mitochondria. The elimination of damaged mitochondria in mammals is mediated by a pathway comprised of PTEN-induced putative protein kinase 1 (PINK1) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. PINK1 and Parkin accumulate on damaged mitochondria, promote their segregation from the mitochondrial network, and target these organelles for autophagic degradation in a process that requires Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins.

Here, we discuss our recent work demonstrating that OPTN (optineurin) is recruited to damaged mitochondria, serving as an autophagy receptor for autophagosome formation around mitochondria. Using high-resolution live-cell imaging, we find that OPTN is recruited to ubiquitinated mitochondria downstream of PARK2, and induces autophagosome assembly around mitochondria via its LC3-interacting region. Mutations in OPTN are linked to both glaucoma and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and an ALS-associated E478G mutation in OPTN's ubiquitin binding domain leads to defective mitophagy and accumulation of damaged mitochondria.

Identification of a nontoxic, anti-apoptotic molecule is warranted for therapy against NSAID-induced gastropathy. The objective of the present study was to define the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect of melatonin, a nontoxic molecule which scavenges reactive oxygen species. Using an array of experimental approaches, we have shown that melatonin prevents the development of mitochondrial oxidative stress and activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by indomethacin (a NSAID) in the gastric mucosa. Melatonin inhibits the important steps of indomethacin-induced activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis such as upregulation of the expression of Bax and Bak, and the downregulation of Bcl-2 and BclxL. Melatonin also prevents indomethacin-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax and prevents the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, melatonin reduces indomethacin-mediated activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by blocking the release of cytochrome c and finally rescues gastric mucosal cells from indomethacin-induced apoptosis as measured by the TUNEL assay. Histologic studies of gastric mucosa further document that melatonin almost completely protects against gastric damage induced by indomethacin. Thus, melatonin has significant anti-apoptotic effects to protect gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced apoptosis and gastropathy, which makes its use as potential therapy against gastric damage during NSAID treatment.",

Fluid biomarkers of AD currently provide indications of disease stage; however, they are not robust predictors of disease progression or treatment response, and most are measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which limits their applicability. With these aspects in mind, the aim of this article is to underscore the concerted efforts of the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group, an international working group of experts in the field. The points addressed include: (1) the major challenges in the development of blood-based biomarkers of AD, including patient heterogeneity, inclusion of the “right” control population, and the blood–brain barrier; (2) the need for a clear definition of the purpose of the individual markers (e.g., prognostic, diagnostic, or monitoring therapeutic efficacy); (3) a critical evaluation of the ongoing biomarker approaches; and (4) highlighting the need for standardization of preanalytical variables and analytical methodologies used by the field.",

Randomization was stratified by time since onset of menopause (≤5 yr or > 5 yr).\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The primary end point was the percent change in lumbar spine BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at 24 months. Additional end points were percent change in volumetric BMD of the distal radius by quantitative computed tomography; percent change in BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for the total hip, one-third radius, and total body; hip structural analysis; percent change in BTMs; and safety.\n\nResults: Denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD, compared with placebo at 24 months (6.5 vs. −0.6%; P<0.0001) with similar results for both strata. Denosumab also produced significant increases in BMD at the total hip, one-third radius, and total body (P < 0.0001 vs. placebo); increased distal radius volumetric BMD (P < 0.01); improved hip structural analysis parameters; and significantly suppressed serum C-telopeptide, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b, and intact N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen.

We identify three miRNAs that are specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and show that their expression is dynamically regulated during early hematopoiesis and lineage commitment. One of these miRNAs, miR-181, was preferentially expressed in the B-lymphoid cells of mouse bone marrow, and its ectopic expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells led to an increased fraction of B-lineage cells in both tissue-culture differentiation assays and adult mice.

Genetic lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that one specific domain, located at the tip of the branching pancreatic tree, contains multipotent progenitors that produce exocrine, endocrine, and duct cells in vivo. These multipotent progenitors are Pdx1+Ptf1a+cMycHighCpa1+ and negative for differentiated lineage markers. The outgrowth of multipotent tip cells leaves behind differentiated progeny that form the trunk of the branches.

PDL is a specialised connective tissue that connects cementum and alveolar bone to maintain and support teeth in situ and preserve tissue homoeostasis. We investigated the notion that human PDL contains stem cells that could be used to regenerate periodontal tissue.\n\nMethods\nPDL tissue was obtained from 25 surgically extracted human third molars and used to isolate PDL stem cells (PDLSCs) by single-colony selection and magnetic activated cell sorting. Immunohistochemical staining, RT-PCR, and northern and western blot analyses were used to identify putative stem-cell markers. Human PDLSCs were transplanted into immunocompromised mice (n=12) and rats (n=6) to assess capacity for tissue regeneration and periodontal repair.\n\nFindings\nPDLSCs expressed the mesenchymal stem-cell markers STRO-1 and CD146/MUC18. Under defined culture conditions, PDLSCs differentiated into cementoblast-like cells, adipocytes, and collagen-forming cells. When transplanted into immunocompromised rodents, PDLSCs showed the capacity to generate a cementum/PDL-like structure and contribute to periodontal tissue repair.\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings suggest that PDL contains stem cells that have the potential to generate cementum/PDL-like tissue in vivo. Transplantation of these cells, which can be obtained from an easily accessible tissue resource and expanded ex vivo, might hold promise as a therapeutic approach for reconstruction of tissues destroyed by periodontal diseases.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 5% of the world population is infected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that causes a necroinflammatory liver disease of variable duration and severity. Chronically infected patients with active liver disease carry a high risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The immune response to HBV-encoded antigens is responsible both for viral clearance and for disease pathogenesis during this infection. While the humoral antibody response to viral envelope antigens contributes to the clearance of circulating virus particles, the cellular immune response to the envelope, nucleocapsid, and polymerase antigens eliminates infected cells. The class I- and class II-restricted T cell responses to the virus are vigorous, polyclonal, and multispecific in acutely infected patients who successfully clear the virus, and the responses are relatively weak and more narrowly focused in chronically infected patients who do not. The pathogenetic and antiviral potential of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HBV has been demonstrated by the induction of a severe necroinflammatory liver disease following the adoptive transfer of HBsAg-specific CTL into HBV transgenic mice, and by the noncytolytic suppression of viral gene expression and replication in the same animals by a posttranscriptional mechanism mediated by interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 2. The dominant cause of viral persistence during HBV infection is the development of a weak antiviral immune response to the viral antigens. While neonatal tolerance probably plays an important role in viral persistence in patients infected at birth, the basis for poor responsiveness in adult-onset infection is not well understood and requires further analysis. Viral evasion by epitope inactivation and T cell receptor antagonism may contribute to the worsening of viral persistence in the setting of an ineffective immune response, as can the incomplete downregulation of viral gene expression and the infection of immunologically privileged tissues. Chronic liver cell injury and the attendant inflammatory and regenerative responses create the mutagenic and mitogenic stimuli for the development of DNA damage that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma. Elucidation of the immunological and virological basis for HBV persistence may yield immunotherapeutic and antiviral strategies to terminate chronic HBV infection and reduce the risk of its life-threatening sequellae.",

Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.\n\nMethods\nWe estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.\n\nFindings\nIn 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% (−7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0). The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% (15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.\n\nInterpretation\nAsthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.",

Nanoparticles can serve as drug delivery systems for growth factors like Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which stimulated osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PEC-NPs) consisting of poly(l-lysine) (PLL) and cellulose sulfate (CS), with or without addition of BDNF, were used to analyze their effect on osteoclasts in vitro. Live cell images showed that osteoclast numbers decreased after application of high PLL/CS PEC-NPs concentrations independent of whether BDNF was added or not. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that relative mRNA expression of cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor significantly declined after incubation of osteoclasts with high concentrations of PLL/CS PEC-NPs. Furthermore, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay indicated that tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase 5b activity was significantly reduced in the presence of high PLL/CS PEC-NPs concentrations. Consistent with these results, the pit formation analysis showed that less hydroxyapatite was resorbed by osteoclasts after incubation with high concentrations of PLL/CS PEC-NPs. BDNF had no influence on osteoclasts. We conclude that highly concentrated PLL/CS PEC-NPs dosages decreased osteoclastogenesis and osteoclasts activity. Moreover, BDNF might be a promising growth factor for osteoporotic fracture treatment since it did not increase osteoclast activity.",

Is it possible to describe how a mind adapts in real time to changes in the physical world through a theory based on a few basic laws? From perception and elementary cognition to emotions and abstract ideas allowing high-level cognition and executive functioning, at nearly all levels of study, the mind shows variability and uncertainties. Is it possible to turn psychology and neuroscience into so-called \"hard\" sciences? This review discusses several established first principles for the description of mind and their mathematical formulations. A mathematical model of mind is derived from these principles. This model includes mechanisms of instincts, emotions, behavior, cognition, concepts, language, intuitions, and imagination. We clarify fundamental notions such as the opposition between the conscious and the unconscious, the knowledge instinct and aesthetic emotions, as well as humans' universal abilities for symbols and meaning. In particular, the review discusses in length evolutionary and cognitive functions of aesthetic emotions and musical emotions. Several theoretical predictions are derived from the model, some of which have been experimentally confirmed. These empirical results are summarized and we introduce new theoretical developments. Several unsolved theoretical problems are proposed, as well as new experimental challenges for future research.",

        "abstract": "The concepts of quantum brain, quantum mind and quantum consciousness have been increasingly gaining currency in recent years, both in scientific papers and in the popular press. In fact, the concept of the quantum brain is a general framework. Included in it are basically four main sub-headings. These are often incorrectly used interchangeably. The first of these and the one which started the quantum mind/consciousness debate was the place of consciousness in the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. Debate on the problem of quantum measurement and about the place of the conscious observer has lasted almost a century. One solution to this problem is that the participation of a conscious observer in the experiment will radically change our understanding of the universe and our relationship with the outside world. The second topic is that of quantum biology. This topic has become a popular field of research, especially in the last decade. It concerns whether or not the rules of quantum physics operate in biological structures. It has been shown in the latest research on photosynthesis, the sense of smell and magnetic direction finding in animals that the laws of quantum physics may operate in warm-wet-noisy biological structures. The third sub-heading is quantum neurobiology. This topic has not yet gained wide acceptance and is still in its early stages. Its primary purpose is directed to understand whether the laws of quantum physics are effective in the biology of the nervous system or not. A further step in brain neurobiology, toward the understanding of consciousness formation, is the research of quantum laws effects upon neural network functions. The fourth and final topic is quantum psychopathology. This topic takes its basis and its support from quantum neurobiology. It comes from the idea that if quantum physics is involved in the normal working of the brain, diseased conditions of the brain such as depression, anxiety, dementia, schizophrenia and hallucinations can be explained by quantum physical pathology. In this article, these topics will be reviewed in a general framework, and for the first time a general classification will be made for the quantum brain theory.",

        "abstract": "Causality has never gained the status of a 'law' or 'principle' in physics. Some recent literature has even popularized the false idea that causality is a notion that should be banned from theory. Such misconception relies on an alleged universality of the reversibility of the laws of physics, based either on the determinism of classical theory, or on the multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, in both cases motivated by mere interpretational requirements for realism of the theory. Here, I will show that a properly defined unambiguous notion of causality is a theorem of quantum theory, which is also a falsifiable proposition of the theory. Such a notion of causality appeared in the literature within the framework of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely theoretical notion, corresponding to establishing a definite partial order among events, in the same way as we do by using the future causal cone on Minkowski space. The notion of causality is logically completely independent of the misidentified concept of 'determinism', and, being a consequence of quantum theory, is ubiquitous in physics. In addition, as classical theory can be regarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds also in the classical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it. I then conclude by arguing that causality naturally establishes an arrow of time. This implies that the scenario of the 'block Universe' and the connected 'past hypothesis' are incompatible with causality, and thus with quantum theory: they are both doomed to remain mere interpretations and, as such, are not falsifiable, similar to the hypothesis of 'super-determinism'.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact on contemporary society'.",

        "abstract": "With the State of California legalizing recreational cannabis sales on January 1, 2018, the regulatory process is once more in the forefront of cannabis research. Colorado, often held up as a model of legalization policy, was the first state to implement retail sale of recreational cannabis on January 1st, 2014. However, a combination of subsequent under-regulation and over-regulation, inconsistently applied across issues such as retail licencing, chemical testing, cannabis derivatives, municipality approval for growers, and financing, have not only held back the industry in Colorado but also negatively impacted public health, oversight, and have potentially increased the availability of illegal cannabis. We argue that a data-analytic approach to the industry is potentially the most effective way to resolve these concerns, since in the absence of consistent and reliable data, policymakers are apt to satisfy individual policy concerns without considering the industry as a whole. In this paper we present a data-analytic framework for the cannabis industry, offering a theoretically-driven justification for our approach, and describe implications for research on drug and information policy. The framework may serve as a model for other states or countries contemplating cannabis legalisation. As four new states legalised recreational cannabis in 2016, the implications of this research for policymakers has dramatically increased.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cannabis (marijuana) has been legalized for recreational and/or medicinal use in many US states, despite remaining a Schedule-I drug at the federal level. As legalization regimes are established in multiple countries, public health professionals should leverage decades of knowledge from other policy areas (e.g., alcohol and tobacco regulation) to inform cannabis policy.Objectives: Identify policy lessons from other more established policy areas that can inform cannabis policy in the United States, Canada, and any other nations that legalize recreational cannabis.Methods: Narrative review of policy and public health literature.Results: We identified six key lessons to guide cannabis policy. To avoid the harms of \"a medical system only in name,\" medical cannabis programs should either be regulated like medicine or combined with the recreational market. Capping potency of cannabis products can reduce the harms of the drug, including addiction. Pricing policies that promote public health may include minimum unit pricing or taxation by weight. Protecting science and public health from corporate interest can prevent the scenarios we have seen with soda and tobacco lobbies funding studies to report favorable results about their products. Legalizing states can go beyond reducing possession arrests (which can be accomplished without legalization) by expunging prior criminal records of cannabis-related convictions. Finally, facilitating rigorous research can differentiate truth from positive and negative hype about cannabis' effects.Conclusion: Scientists and policymakers can learn from the successes and failures of alcohol and tobacco policy to regulate cannabis products, thereby mitigating old harms of cannabis prohibition while reducing new harms from legalization.",

This report aimed to (1) briefly describe the regulatory regimes so far implemented; (2) outline their plausible effects on cannabis use and cannabis-related harm; and (3) suggest what research is needed to evaluate the public health impact of these policy changes.\n\nMethod: We reviewed the drug policy literature to identify: (1) plausible effects of legalizing adult recreational use on cannabis price and availability; (2) factors that may increase or limit these effects; (3) pointers from studies of the effects of legalizing medical cannabis use; and (4) indicators of cannabis use and cannabis-related harm that can be monitored to assess the effects of these policy changes.\n\nResults: Legalization of recreational use will probably increase use in the long term, but the magnitude and timing of any increase is uncertain. It will be critical to monitor: cannabis use in household and high school surveys; cannabis sales; the number of cannabis plants legally produced; and the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of cannabis.

We review US research on the effects of legalization on cannabis use among adults and adolescents and on cannabis-related harms; the impact of legalizing adult recreational use on cannabis price, availability, potency and use; and regulatory policies that may increase or limit adverse effects of legalization. The legalization of recreational cannabis use in the US has substantially reduced the price of cannabis, increased its potency, and made cannabis more available to adult users. It appears to have increased the frequency of cannabis use among adults, but not so far among youth. It has also increased emergency department attendances and hospitalizations for some cannabis-related harms. The relatively modest effects on cannabis use to date probably reflect restrictions on the number and locations of retail cannabis outlets and the constraints on commercialization under a continued federal prohibition of cannabis. Future evaluations of legalization should monitor: cannabis sales volumes, prices and content of tetrahydrocannabinol; prevalence and frequency of cannabis use among adolescents and adults in household and high school surveys; car crash fatalities and injuries involving drivers who are cannabis-impaired; emergency department presentations related to cannabis; the demand for treatment of cannabis use disorders; and the prevalence of regular cannabis use among vulnerable young people in mental health services, schools and the criminal justice system.

The prohibition of traditional tobacco cigarettes has been advocated as a way to eliminate cigarette smoking. These proposals embody very different attitudes towards the harms of recreational adult drug use. Advocates of nicotine prohibition demand that alternative methods of nicotine delivery must be shown to be completely safe before adults are allowed to use them. Advocates of tobacco prohibition ignore evidence that smokers may not use these products and the likelihood of expanding the illicit tobacco market. Advocates of legalizing and regulating recreational cannabis ignore the need to tax and regulate sales in order to minimize the harms of heavy use.\n\nConclusions: It is not clear that the prohibition of adult use has a useful role to play in the regulation of either cannabis or tobacco. If both products remain legal, the goals of regulating tobacco and cannabis products should be to restrict youth access, promote the use of the least harmful products, provide users with evidence-based information on both absolute and differential product risks of use and use differential taxes and marketing controls to promote ways of using these products that cause the least harm to their users.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis is widely used among adolescents and adults. In the U.S., marijuana laws have been changing, and Americans increasingly favor legalizing cannabis for medical and recreational uses. While some can use cannabis without harm, others experience adverse consequences. The objective of this review is to summarize information on the legal status of cannabis, perceptions regarding cannabis, prevalence and time trends in use and related adverse consequences, and evidence on the relationship of state medical (MML) and recreational (RML) marijuana laws to use and attitudes. Twenty-nine states now have MMLs, and eight of these have RMLs. Since the early 2000s, adult and adolescent perception of cannabis use as risky has decreased. Over the same time, the prevalence of adolescent cannabis use has changed little. However, adult cannabis use, disorders, and related consequences have increased. Multiple nationally representative studies indicate that MMLs have had little effect on cannabis use among adolescents. However, while MML effects have been less studied in adults, available evidence suggests that MMLs increase use and cannabis use disorders in adults. While data are not yet available to evaluate the effect of RMLs, they are likely to lower price, increase availability, and thereby increase cannabis use. More permissive marijuana laws may accomplish social justice aims (e.g., reduce racial disparities in law enforcement) and generate tax revenues. However, such laws may increase cannabis-related adverse health and psychosocial consequences by increasing the population of users.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of students with mathematics learning disabilities has triggered an interest among special education researchers and practitioners in developing an understanding of the needs of this group of students, and in identifying effective instructional programming to foster their mathematical performance during the school years and into adulthood. Research into the characteristics of students with mathematics learning disabilities is being approached from different perspectives, including developmental, neurological and neuropsychological, and educational. This diversity helps us develop a broader understanding of students' learning needs and difficulties. Special education assessment practices encompass a variety of approaches, including norm-referenced, criterion-referenced, and nonstandardized procedures, depending on the specific assessment questions professionals seek to answer. Students' mathematical knowledge and conceptual understanding must be examined to determine their strengths and weaknesses, curriculum-based progress, and use of cognitive strategies to arrive at mathematical solutions. Research findings have identified empirically validated interventions for teaching mathematics curricula to students with mathematics learning disabilities. Research studies have been grounded in behavioral theory and cognitive psychology, with an emergent interest in the constructivist approach. Although research studies have focused primarily on computational performance, more work is being conducted in the areas of story-problem solving and technology. These areas as well as other math curricular skills require further study. Additionally, the needs of adults with math LD have spurred educators to examine the elementary and secondary math curricula and determine ways to infuse them with life skills instruction accordingly. As the field of mathematics special education continues to evolve, special educators must remain cognizant of the developments in and influences on the field of mathematics education. Reform efforts have shaped the field significantly since the 1950s, contributing to the curriculum offered in mathematics textbooks and the pedagogical practices taught in higher education courses. Mathematics educators continue to search for a better understanding of how children learn mathematics; this process is shaped by the prevailing theoretical orientations and research methodologies. This special series in mathematics special education provides readers with information about the characteristics of students with mathematics learning disabilities, assessment procedures, mathematics programming, teacher preparation, and future directions for the field. The series originated as a result of discussions with Dr. Lee Wiederholt and Dr. Judith K. Voress, who saw a need for the compilation of recent research and best practices in mathematics special education. I thank them for their support of and thoughtful insights about the development of this series. I also appreciate the support of Dr. George Hynd and his editorial assistant, Kathryn Black, in finalizing the details for publication.

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this tutorial is to discuss the use of curriculum-based language assessment (CBLA) with students who are English language learners and students who speak nonmainstream varieties of English, such as African American English.\n\nMethod: The article begins with a discussion of the discourse of mathematics and the role of the speech-language pathologist (SLP), followed by a review of studies that includes those that examined the performance of English language learner and nonmainstream dialect-speaking students on word-based math items.\n\nResults: The literature review highlights the linguistic and content biases associated with word-based math problems. Useful strategies that SLPs and educators can incorporate in culturally and linguistically appropriate assessments are discussed. The tutorial ends with a discussion of CBLA as a viable assessment approach to use with culturally and linguistically diverse students.\n\nConclusions: Tests used at national, state, and school levels to assess students' math abilities have associated linguistic bias and content bias often leading to an inaccurate depiction of culturally and linguistically diverse students' math skills. CBLA as an assessment method can be used by school-based SLPs to gather valid and useful information about culturally and linguistically diverse students' language for learning math. By using CBLA, SLPs can help modify curricular tasks in broader contexts in an effort to make math, including high-level math, \"accessible and achievable for all\" students (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2017).",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Effective teaching and learning mathematics is important to achieve good results during an academic and professional career. This is especially difficult for visually impaired students because of difficulties in managing structural information included in maths formulae.\n\nMethods: The extended multimedia alternative method, including the problem of decomposition and knowledge vector, were presented and compared to the classical teaching method. A qualitative method to evaluate motivation during the process of teaching and learning maths for impaired students, which includes eleven detailed motivators, has been developed.\n\nResults: The alternative teaching method offers statistically significant improvements in four of the eleven proposed assessment categories: success in progress - adjusting the difficulties of learning, presentation of the material, approval: group/individual and alternative presentation of mathematic materials. The experiments carried out allowed the authors to increase the knowledge about the limitations and challenges occurring in the process of maths education among visually impaired students and their motivation.\n\nConclusions: Based on the experiments and research results, it can be concluded that applying the proposed method of decomposition together with evaluation procedure based on the vector of knowledge in the process of teaching and learning of mathematics by visually impaired may increase their motivation positively. Implications for Rehabilitation The key aspects of the alternative method of presenting math formulae are included in the bellow points: • It increases the availability of materials containing structured information (mathematical formulae) for the blind. • It limits the importance of communication barriers in math education: the possibility of self-study, reducing costs - by reducing the number of individual tutorials. • It contributes to the development of universal rules for the structural presentation of information • It increases the independence of the student from the teacher.\n\nKeywords: Alternative math presentation; interactive multimedia math presentation; math tutoring platform; mathematics; student motivation.",

        "abstract": "Interprofessional education is a collaborative approach to develop healthcare students as future interprofessional team members and a recommendation suggested by the Institute of Medicine. Complex medical issues can be best addressed by interprofessional teams. Training future healthcare providers to work in such teams will help facilitate this model resulting in improved healthcare outcomes for patients. In this paper, three universities, the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, the University of Florida and the University of Washington describe their training curricula models of collaborative and interprofessional education.The models represent a didactic program, a community-based experience and an interprofessional-simulation experience. The didactic program emphasizes interprofessional team building skills, knowledge of professions, patient centered care, service learning, the impact of culture on healthcare delivery and an interprofessional clinical component. The community-based experience demonstrates how interprofessional collaborations provide service to patients and how the environment and availability of resources impact one's health status. The interprofessional-simulation experience describes clinical team skills training in both formative and summative simulations used to develop skills in communication and leadership.One common theme leading to a successful experience among these three interprofessional models included helping students to understand their own professional identity while gaining an understanding of other professional's roles on the health care team. Commitment from departments and colleges, diverse calendar agreements, curricular mapping, mentor and faculty training, a sense of community, adequate physical space, technology, and community relationships were all identified as critical resources for a successful program. Summary recommendations for best practices included the need for administrative support, interprofessional programmatic infrastructure, committed faculty, and the recognition of student participation as key components to success for anyone developing an IPE centered program.",

Many existing faculty members feel ill-prepared to face the challenges of this curricular innovation. From 2012-2013, University of Missouri - Columbia and University of Washington partnered with six additional academic health centers to pilot a faculty development course to prepare faculty leaders for IPE. Using a variety of techniques, including didactic teaching, small group exercises, immersion participation in interprofessional education, local implementation of new IPE projects, and peer learning, the program positioned each site to successfully introduce an interprofessional innovation. Participating faculty confirmed the value of the program, and suggested that more widespread similar efforts were worthwhile. This guide briefly describes this faculty development program and identifies key lessons learned from the initiative. Peer learning arising from a faculty development community, adaptation of curricula to fit local context, experiential learning, and ongoing coaching/mentoring, especially as it related to actual participation in IPE activities, were among the key elements of this successful faculty development activity.",

This systematic review of the literature examines the quality of e-learning effectiveness studies in pharmacy, describes effectiveness measures, and synthesizes the evidence for each measure. E-learning in pharmacy education effectively increases knowledge and is a highly acceptable instructional format for pharmacists and pharmacy students. However, there is limited evidence that e-learning effectively improves skills or professional practice. There is also no evidence that e-learning is effective at increasing knowledge long term; thus, long-term follow-up studies are required.

Gamification has been used widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and education.\n\nObjective: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy curricula.\n\nDiscussion: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based learning are financial, cultural, and technological.\n\nConclusion: Many areas of the pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school classroom.\n\nKeywords: Active learning; Game-based learning; Gamification; Pharmacy education.",

However, previous results concerning the relationship between math anxiety and performance are contradictory, with some studies establishing a correlation between them while others do not. These contradictory results might be related to varying operationalizations of math anxiety.\n\nAims: In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence of math anxiety and its relationship with basic arithmetic skills in primary school children, with explicit focus on two aspects of math anxiety: anxiety about failure in mathematics and anxiety in math-related situations.\n\nSample: The participants comprised 1,327 children at grades 2-5.\n\nMethods: Math anxiety was assessed using six items, and basic arithmetic skills were assessed using three assessment tasks.\n\nResults: Around one-third of the participants reported anxiety about being unable to do math, one-fifth about having to answer teachers' questions, and one tenth about having to do math. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that anxiety about math-related situations and anxiety about failure in mathematics are separable aspects of math anxiety. Structural equation modelling suggested that anxiety about math-related situations was more strongly associated with arithmetic fluency than anxiety about failure. Anxiety about math-related situations was most common among second graders and least common among fifth graders.\n\nConclusions: As math anxiety, particularly about math-related situations, was related to arithmetic fluency even as early as the second grade, children's negative feelings and math anxiety should be identified and addressed from the early primary school years.",

The goal of the study was to better understand why some students perform worse in math than others. We tested whether parents' math anxiety predicts their children's math achievement across the school year. We found that when parents are more math anxious, their children learn significantly less math over the school year and have more math anxiety by the school year's end-but only if math-anxious parents report providing frequent help with math homework. Notably, when parents reported helping with math homework less often, children's math achievement and attitudes were not related to parents' math anxiety. Parents' math anxiety did not predict children's reading achievement, which suggests that the effects of parents' math anxiety are specific to children's math achievement. These findings provide evidence of a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of low math achievement and high math anxiety.",

Four measurement formats were examined including, 2 broad-based (i.e., self-report questionnaire and teacher ratings) and 2 task-specific measures (i.e., SRL microanalysis and behavioral traces). Convergent validity was examined across task-difficulty, and the predictive validity was examined across 3 mathematics outcomes: 2 measures of mathematical problem solving skill (i.e., practice session math problems, posttest math problems) and a global measure of mathematical skill (i.e., standardized math test). Correlation analyses were used to examine convergent validity and revealed medium correlations between measures within the same category (i.e., broad-based or task-specific). Relations between measurement classes were not statistically significant. Separate regressions examined the predictive validity of the SRL measures. While controlling all other predictors, a SRL microanalysis metacognitive-monitoring measure emerged as a significant predictor of all 3 outcomes and teacher ratings accounted for unique variance on 2 of the outcomes (i.e., posttest math problems and standardized math test). Results suggest that a multidimensional assessment approach should be considered by school psychologists interested in measuring SRL. (PsycINFO Database Record",

        "abstract": "Multiple linkages connect air quality and climate change. Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to \"unmasking\" of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies.",

        "abstract": "Emissions of air pollutants and their precursors determine regional air quality and can alter climate. Climate change can perturb the long-range transport, chemical processing, and local meteorology that influence air pollution. We review the implications of projected changes in methane (CH(4)), ozone precursors (O(3)), and aerosols for climate (expressed in terms of the radiative forcing metric or changes in global surface temperature) and hemispheric-to-continental scale air quality. Reducing the O(3) precursor CH(4) would slow near-term warming by decreasing both CH(4) and tropospheric O(3). Uncertainty remains as to the net climate forcing from anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emissions, which increase tropospheric O(3) (warming) but also increase aerosols and decrease CH(4) (both cooling). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and non-CH(4) volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) warm by increasing both O(3) and CH(4). Radiative impacts from secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are poorly understood. Black carbon emission controls, by reducing the absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere and on snow and ice, have the potential to slow near-term warming, but uncertainties in coincident emissions of reflective (cooling) aerosols and poorly constrained cloud indirect effects confound robust estimates of net climate impacts. Reducing sulfate and nitrate aerosols would improve air quality and lessen interference with the hydrologic cycle, but lead to warming. A holistic and balanced view is thus needed to assess how air pollution controls influence climate; a first step towards this goal involves estimating net climate impacts from individual emission sectors. Modeling and observational analyses suggest a warming climate degrades air quality (increasing surface O(3) and particulate matter) in many populated regions, including during pollution episodes. Prior Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (SRES) allowed unconstrained growth, whereas the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios assume uniformly an aggressive reduction, of air pollutant emissions. New estimates from the current generation of chemistry-climate models with RCP emissions thus project improved air quality over the next century relative to those using the IPCC SRES scenarios. These two sets of projections likely bracket possible futures. We find that uncertainty in emission-driven changes in air quality is generally greater than uncertainty in climate-driven changes. Confidence in air quality projections is limited by the reliability of anthropogenic emission trajectories and the uncertainties in regional climate responses, feedbacks with the terrestrial biosphere, and oxidation pathways affecting O(3) and SOA.",

        "title": "Climate change impacts on human health over Europe through its effect on air quality",
        "abstract": "This review examines the current literature on the effects of future emissions and climate change on particulate matter (PM) and O3 air quality and on the consequent health impacts, with a focus on Europe. There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O3 that offset the O3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O3 - termed the O3 climate penalty - especially in southern Europe. The O3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O3 distribution, such as daily maximum O3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100.A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O3 have been identified.There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100. For future health effects, besides uncertainty in future O3 and particularly PM concentrations, there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant-response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk.",

        "title": "Future ozone-related acute excess mortality under climate and population change scenarios in China: A modeling study",
        "abstract": "Background: Climate change is likely to further worsen ozone pollution in already heavily polluted areas, leading to increased ozone-related health burdens. However, little evidence exists in China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and most populated country. As China is embracing an aging population with changing population size and falling age-standardized mortality rates, the potential impact of population change on ozone-related health burdens is unclear. Moreover, little is known about the seasonal variation of ozone-related health burdens under climate change. We aimed to assess near-term (mid-21st century) future annual and seasonal excess mortality from short-term exposure to ambient ozone in 104 Chinese cities under 2 climate and emission change scenarios and 6 population change scenarios.\n\nMethods and findings: We collected historical ambient ozone observations, population change projections, and baseline mortality rates in 104 cities across China during April 27, 2013, to October 31, 2015 (2013-2015), which included approximately 13% of the total population of mainland China. Using historical ozone monitoring data, we performed bias correction and spatially downscaled future ozone projections at a coarse spatial resolution (2.0° × 2.5°) for the period April 27, 2053, to October 31, 2055 (2053-2055), from a global chemistry-climate model to a fine spatial resolution (0.25° × 0.25°) under 2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5, a moderate global warming and emission scenario where global warming is between 1.5°C and 2.0°C, and RCP8.5, a high global warming and emission scenario where global warming exceeds 2.0°C. We then estimated the future annual and seasonal ozone-related acute excess mortality attributable to both climate and population changes using cause-specific, age-group-specific, and season-specific concentration-response functions (CRFs). We used Monte Carlo simulations to obtain empirical confidence intervals (eCIs), quantifying the uncertainty in CRFs and the variability across ensemble members (i.e., 3 predictions of future climate and air quality from slightly different starting conditions) of the global model. Estimates of future changes in annual ozone-related mortality are sensitive to the choice of global warming and emission scenario, decreasing under RCP4.5 (-24.0%) due to declining ozone precursor emissions but increasing under RCP8.5 (10.7%) due to warming climate in 2053-2055 relative to 2013-2015. Higher ambient ozone occurs under the high global warming and emission scenario (RCP8.5), leading to an excess 1,476 (95% eCI: 898 to 2,977) non-accidental deaths per year in 2053-2055 relative to 2013-2015. Future ozone-related acute excess mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 5-8 times greater than that from respiratory diseases. Ozone concentrations increase by 15.1 parts per billion (10-9) in colder months (November to April), contributing to a net yearly increase of 22.3% (95% eCI: 7.7% to 35.4%) in ozone-related mortality under RCP8.5. An aging population, with the proportion of the population aged 65 years and above increased from 8% in 2010 to 24%-33% in 2050, will substantially amplify future ozone-related mortality, leading to a net increase of 23,838 to 78,560 deaths (110% to 363%). Our analysis was mainly limited by using a single global chemistry-climate model and the statistical downscaling approach to project ozone changes under climate change.\n\nConclusions: Our analysis shows increased future ozone-related acute excess mortality under the high global warming and emission scenario RCP8.5 for an aging population in China. Comparison with the lower global warming and emission scenario RCP4.5 suggests that climate change mitigation measures are needed to prevent a rising health burden from exposure to ambient ozone pollution in China.",

        "title": "Assessment and statistical modeling of the relationship between remotely sensed aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 in the eastern United States",
        "abstract": "Research in scientific, public health, and policy disciplines relating to the environment increasingly makes use of high-dimensional remote sensing and the output of numerical models in conjunction with traditional observations. Given the public health and resultant public policy implications of the potential health effects of particulate matter (PM*) air pollution, specifically fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 pm (PM2.5), there has been substantial recent interest in the use of remote-sensing information, in particular aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from satellites, to help characterize variability in ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in space and time. While the United States and some other developed countries have extensive PM monitoring networks, gaps in data across space and time necessarily occur; the hope is that remote sensing can help fill these gaps. In this report, we are particularly interested in using remote-sensing data to inform estimates of spatial patterns in ambient PM2.5 concentrations at monthly and longer time scales for use in epidemiologic analyses. However, we also analyzed daily data to better disentangle spatial and temporal relationships. For AOD to be helpful, it needs to add information beyond that available from the monitoring network. For analyses of chronic health effects, it needs to add information about the concentrations of long-term average PM2.5; therefore, filling the spatial gaps is key. Much recent evidence has shown that AOD is correlated with PM2.5 in the eastern United States, but the use of AOD in exposure analysis for epidemiologic work has been rare, in part because discrepancies necessarily exist between satellite-retrieved estimates of AOD, which is an atmospheric-column average, and ground-level PM2.5. In this report, we summarize the results of a number of empirical analyses and of the development of statistical models for the use of proxy information, in particular satellite AOD, in predicting PM2.5 concentrations in the eastern United States. We analyzed the spatiotemporal structure of the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD, first using simple correlations both before and after calibration based on meteorology, as well as large-scale spatial and temporal calibration to account for discrepancies between AOD and PM2.5. We then used both raw and calibrated AOD retrievals in statistical models to predict PM2.5 concentrations, accounting for AOD in two ways: primarily as a separate data source contributing a second likelihood to a Bayesian statistical model, as well as a data source on which we could directly regress. Previous consideration of satellite AOD has largely focused on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) instruments. One contribution of our work is more extensive consideration of AOD derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite East Aerosol/Smoke Product (GOES GASP) AOD and its relationship with PM2.5. In addition to empirically assessing the spatiotemporal relationship between GASP AOD and PM2.5, we considered new statistical techniques to screen anomalous GOES reflectance measurements and account for background surface reflectance. In our statistical work, we developed a new model structure that allowed for more flexible modeling of the proxy discrepancy than previous statistical efforts have had, with a computationally efficient implementation. We also suggested a diagnostic for assessing the scales of the spatial relationship between the proxy and the spatial process of interest (e.g., PM2.5). In brief, we had little success in improving predictions in our eastern-United States domain for use in epidemiologic applications. We found positive correlations of AOD with PM2.5 over time, but less correlation for long-term averages over space, unless we used calibration that adjusted for large-scale discrepancy between AOD and PM2.5 (see sections 3, 4, and 5). Statistical models that combined AOD, PM2.5 observations, and land-use and meteorologic variables were highly predictive of PM2.5 observations held out of the modeling, but AOD added little information beyond that provided by the other sources (see sections 5 and 6). When we used PM2.5 data estimates from the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) as the proxy instead of using AOD, we similarly found little improvement in predicting held-out observations of PM2.5, but when we regressed on CMAQ PM2.5 estimates, the predictions improved moderately in some cases. These results appeared to be caused in part by the fact that large-scale spatial patterns in PM2.5 could be predicted well by smoothing the monitor values, while small-scale spatial patterns in AOD appeared to weakly reflect the variation in PM2.5 inferred from the observations. Using a statistical model that allowed for potential proxy discrepancy at both large and small spatial scales was an important component of our modeling. In particular, when our models did not include a component to account for small-scale discrepancy, predictive performance decreased substantially. Even long-term averages of MISR AOD, considered the best, albeit most sparse, of the AOD products, were only weakly correlated with measured PM2.5 (see section 4). This might have been partly related to the fact that our analysis did not account for spatial variation in the vertical profile of the aerosol. Furthermore, we found evidence that some of the correlation between raw AOD and PM2.5 might have been a function of surface brightness related to land use, rather than having been driven by the detection of aerosol in the AOD retrieval algorithms (see sections 4 and 7). Difficulties in estimating the background surface reflectance in the retrieval algorithms likely explain this finding. With regard to GOES, we found moderate correlations of GASP AOD and PM2.5. The higher correlations of monthly and yearly averages after calibration reflected primarily the improved large-scale correlation, a necessary result of the calibration procedure (see section 3). While the results of this study's GOES reflectance screening and surface reflection correction appeared sensible, correlations of our proposed reflectance-based proxy with PM2.5 were no better than GASP AOD correlations with PM2.5 (see section 7). We had difficulty improving spatial prediction of monthly and yearly average PM2.5 using AOD in the eastern United States, which we attribute to the spatial discrepancy between AOD and measured PM2.5, particularly at smaller scales. This points to the importance of paying attention to the discrepancy structure of proxy information, both from remote-sensing and deterministic models. In particular, important statistical challenges arise in accounting for the discrepancy, given the difficulty in the face of sparse observations of distinguishing the discrepancy from the component of the proxy that is informative about the process of interest. Associations between adverse health outcomes and large-scale variation in PM2.5 (e.g., across regions) may be confounded by unmeasured spatial variation in factors such as diet. Therefore, one important goal was to use AOD to improve predictions of PM2.5 for use in epidemiologic analyses at small-to-moderate spatial scales (within urban areas and within regions). In addition, large-scale PM2.5 variation is well estimated from the monitoring data, at least in the United States. We found little evidence that current AOD products are helpful for improving prediction at small-to-moderate scales in the eastern United States and believe more evidence for the reliability of AOD as a proxy at such scales is needed before making use of AOD for PM2.5 prediction in epidemiologic contexts. While our results relied in part on relatively complicated statistical models, which may be sensitive to modeling assumptions, our exploratory correlation analyses (see sections 3 and 5) and relatively simple regression-style modeling of MISR AOD (see section 4) were consistent with the more complicated modeling results. When assessing the usefulness of AOD in the context of studying chronic health effects, we believe efforts need to focus on disentangling the temporal from the spatial correlations of AOD and PM2.5 and on understanding the spatial scale of correlation and of the discrepancy structure. While our results are discouraging, it is important to note that we attempted to make use of smaller-scale spatial variation in AOD to distinguish spatial variations of relatively small magnitude in long-term concentrations of ambient PM2.5. Our efforts pushed the limits of current technology in a spatial domain with relatively low PM2.5 levels and limited spatial variability. AOD may hold more promise in areas with higher aerosol levels, as the AOD signal would be stronger there relative to the background surface reflectance. Furthermore, for developing countries with high aerosol levels, it is difficult to build statistical models based on PM2.5 measurements and land-use covariates, so AOD may add more incremental information in those contexts. More generally, researchers in remote sensing are involved in ongoing efforts to improve AOD products and develop new approaches to using AOD, such as calibration with model-estimated vertical profiles and the use of speciation information in MISR AOD; these efforts warrant continued investigation of the usefulness of remotely sensed AOD for public health research.",

        "abstract": "In 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a major air quality program known as the Particulate Matter (PM) Supersites Program. The Supersites Program was a multiyear, $27 million air quality monitoring program consisting of eight regional air quality projects located throughout the United States, each with differing atmospheric pollution conditions resulting from variations in source emissions and meteorology. The overall goal of the program was to elucidate source-receptor relationships and atmospheric processes leading to PM accumulation on urban and regional scales; thus providing the scientific underpinning for modeling and data analysis efforts to support State Implementation Plans and more effective risk management approaches for PM. The program had three main objectives: (1) conduct methods development and evaluation, (2) characterize ambient PM, and (3) support health effects and exposure research. This paper provides a synthesis of key scientific findings from the Supersites Program and related studies. EPA developed 16 science/policy-relevant questions in conjunction with state and other federal agencies, Regional Planning Organizations, and the private sector. These questions were addressed to the extent possible, even given the vast amount of new information available from the Supersites Program, in a series of papers published as a special issue of the Journal of Air & Waste Management Association (February 2008). This synthesis also includes discussions of: (1) initial Supersites Program support for air quality management efforts in specific locations throughout the United States; (2) selected policy-relevant insights, based on atmospheric sciences findings, useful to air quality managers and decision makers planning emissions management strategies to address current and future PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and network planning and implementation; (3) selected health-relevant insights interpreted from atmospheric sciences findings in light of future directions for health and exposure scientists planning studies of the effects of PM on human health; and (4) selected knowledge gaps to guide future research. Finally, given the scope and depth of research and findings from the Supersites Program, this paper provides a reference source so readers can glean a general understanding of the overall research conducted and its policy-relevant insights.

        "abstract": "Air quality can be affected by weather and thus is sensitive to a changing climate. Wildfire (influenced by weather), consecutive high temperature summer days, and other extreme events are projected to become more severe and frequent with climate change. These may create challenging conditions for managing air quality despite policy targets to reduce precursor and pollutant emissions. Although extreme events are becoming more intense and interest in climate adaptation is increasing among public health practitioners, little attention in scholarly literature and policy covers climate adaptation for air quality governance. Understanding the management and managers' perspectives at the local level provides insight about the needs for climate adaptation, including their adaptation status, perspectives, responsibilities, and roles. This study explores local manager perspectives and experiences of managing air quality within a changing climate as one puzzle piece to understand the gap in climate adaptation within the air quality sector. A broader goal is to contribute to the discussion of developing a multi-jurisdictional vision for reducing the impacts of air quality in a changing climate. In 2016 local air quality district managers in California were invited to participate in an online survey of 39 questions focused on extreme event impacts on air quality. The questionnaire focused on present air quality threats and extreme event challenges, adaptation status and strategies, adaptive capacities, perceived barriers to adaptation, and jurisdictional responsibilities and roles. Over 85 percent of the 35 local air districts in California participated in the survey, which represents 80 percent of the state's population. High awareness and knowledge of climate change among local managers indicates they are ready to adopt and take action on policies that would support climate adaptation, but barriers reported suggests they may need policies and adequate funding to take action and make necessary changes.",

Using this framework, we evaluated outputs of projects funded by the U.S. Geological Survey's Community for Data Integration (CDI). We found that the various outputs are widely accessible, but not necessarily sustained or maintained. Projects with most sustainability influences often became institutionalized and met required needs of the community. Even if proposed outputs were not delivered or sustained, knowledge of lessons learned could be spread to build community capacity in a topic, which is another type of sustainability.

Ecosystems and critical zones are congruent across spatial-temporal scales from vegetation-clad weathering profiles and hillslopes, small catchments, landscapes, river basins, continents, to Earth's whole terrestrial surface. What may be less obvious is congruence in the vertical dimension. We use ecosystem metabolism to argue that full accounting of photosynthetically fixed carbon includes respiratory CO₂ and carbonic acid that propagate to the base of the critical zone itself. Although a small fraction of respiration, the downward diffusion of CO₂ helps determine rates of soil formation and, ultimately, ecosystem evolution and resilience. Because life in the upper portions of terrestrial ecosystems significantly affects biogeochemistry throughout weathering profiles, the lower boundaries of most terrestrial ecosystems have been demarcated at depths too shallow to permit a complete understanding of ecosystem structure and function.

With this, an electron beam of [Formula: see text](50 GeV) could be available for new fixed-target or beam-dump experiments searching for the hidden sector, like dark photons. The rate of electrons on target could be increased by a factor of more than 1000 compared to that currently available, leading to a corresponding increase in sensitivity to new physics. Such a beam could also be brought into collision with a high-power laser and thereby probe the completely unmeasured region of strong fields at values of the Schwinger critical field. An ultimate goal is to produce an electron beam of [Formula: see text](3 TeV) and collide with an Large Hadron Collider proton beam. This very high-energy electron-proton collider would probe a new regime in which the structure of matter is completely unknown. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Directions in particle beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration'.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of musical interventions on the spirituality of patients, regardless of diagnoses.\n\nMethod: This was a systematic literature review that followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations conducted through a relevant search of terms in six databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and LILACS) without temporal delimitation. Experimental or quasi-experimental studies were included, involving participants regardless of diagnoses, to assess the effect of music on spirituality, either through musical intervention as music medicine or through music therapy. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale.\n\nResults: A total of 147 studies were identified; 7 met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were randomized controlled trials involving six music therapists leading the musical intervention with the active participation of patients. The interventions used were heterogeneous. Three studies were associated with improved spirituality after the intervention. Four studies used measurements to evaluate spiritual well-being.\n\nConclusion: This review did not allow ascertaining the positive impact of music intervention on spirituality in patients, which motivates further research.",

        "abstract": "Sleep loss is a widespread problem with serious physical and economic consequences. Music can impact upon physical, psychological and emotional states, which may explain anecdotal reports of its success as an everyday sleep aid. However, there is a lack of systematic data on how widely it is used, why people opt for music as a sleep aid, or what music works; hence the underlying drivers to music-sleep effects remain unclear. We investigated music as a sleep aid within the general public via a mixed methods data online survey (n = 651) that scored musicality, sleep habits, and open text responses on what music helps sleep and why. In total, 62% of respondents stated that they used music to help them sleep. They reported fourteen musical genres comprising 545 artists. Linear modelling found stress, age, and music use as significant predictors of sleep quality (PSQI) scores. Regression tree modelling revealed that younger people with higher musical engagement were significantly more likely to use music to aid sleep. Thematic analysis of the open text responses generated four themes that described why people believe music helps sleep: music offers unique properties that stimulate sleep (Provide), music is part of a normal sleep routine (Habit), music induces a physical or mental state conducive to sleep (State), and music blocks an internal or external stimulus that would otherwise disrupt sleep (Distract). This survey provides new evidence into the relationship between music and sleep in a population that ranged widely in age, musicality, sleep habits and stress levels. In particular, the results highlight the varied pathways of effect between music and sleep. Diversity was observed both in music choices, which reflected idiosyncratic preferences rather than any consistent musical structure, and in the reasons why music supports good sleep, which went far beyond simple physical/mental relaxation.",

The data set contained 576 performance measurements from 34 trials. The trials were all conducted according to a similar experimental protocol from 1997 to 2012. The age of the animals ranged from 21 to 65 weeks. The experimental diets were predominantly wheat/SBM based, fed in mash form ad libitum. Depending on the trial and the treatment group considered, canthaxanthin supplementation was in the range of 0 to 8 mg/kg of feed. Using a linear mixed model regression applied to all 34 trials simultaneously, significant dose-dependent increases were found in egg yolk mass (+0.53% per ppm of canthaxanthin inclusion in the feed, P < 0.001), in egg mass (+0.47% per ppm, P = 0.0132), egg weight (+0.17% per ppm, P = 0.046), and in feed intake (+0.32% per ppm, P = 0.0054). A numerical increase was found in egg production (+0.28%, P = 0.14). The FCR decreased numerically (−0.24% per ppm, P = 0.36). The deposition of canthaxanthin in the egg yolk was 2.25 ppm per ppm of canthaxanthin in the feed (P < 0.001). It is concluded that in addition to egg yolk pigmentation, antioxidant effect, enhanced reproduction, and immune-modulation, canthaxanthin can significantly increase egg mass, thereby enhancing the productivity of the flock.

The aim of the present study was to identify different segments of consumers according to their motivation for following a vegan diet. Another objective was to analyse the attitudes of these consumers towards animal agriculture. The main focus was to determine whether all consumers following a vegan diet oppose animal agriculture in general or if some of these consumers accept certain forms of animal agriculture. The 2014 study, conducted at seven vegan supermarkets in Germany, was based on face-to-face interviews with 329 consumers following a vegan diet. The open question on consumer motivations for adopting a vegan diet revealed three main motives: Animal-related motives (mentioned by 89.7% of the respondents), motives related to personal well-being and/or health (69.3%), and environment-related motives (46.8%). The two-step cluster analysis identified five consumer segments with different motivations for following a vegan diet. The vast majority of respondents (81.8%) mentioned more than one motive. We conclude that making a dichotomous segmentation into ethical versus self-oriented consumers, as previous authors have done, disregards the fact that many consumers following a vegan diet are driven by more than one motive. The consumer segments had significantly different attitudes towards animal agriculture. We identified consumers following a vegan diet (about one third of the sample) who might be open to forms of animal agriculture guaranteeing animal welfare standards going beyond current practices. The present study has interesting implications for the food sector and the agricultural sector.",

        "abstract": "People who avoid eating animals tend to share their homes with animal companions, and moral dilemma may arise when they are faced with feeding animal products to their omnivorous dogs and carnivorous cats. One option to alleviate this conflict is to feed pets a diet devoid of animal ingredients—a ‘plant-based’ or ‘vegan’ diet. The number of pet owners who avoid animal products, either in their own or in their pets’ diet, is not currently known. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of meat-avoiding pet owners, identify concerns regarding conventional animal- and plant-based pet food, and estimate the number of pets fed a plant-based diet. A questionnaire was disseminated online to Englishspeaking pet owners (n = 3,673) to collect data regarding pet owner demographics, diet, pet type, pet diet, and concerns regarding pet foods. Results found that pet owners were more likely to be vegetarian (6.2%; 229/3,673) or vegan (5.8%; 212/3,673) than previously reported for members of the general population. With the exception of one dog owned by a vegetarian, vegans were the only pet owners who fed plant-based diets to their pets (1.6%; 59/3,673). Of the pet owners who did not currently feed plant-based diets but expressed interest in idng so, a large proportion (45%; 269/599) desired more information demonstrating the nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets. Amongst all pet owners, the concern most commonly reported regarding meat-based pet foods was for the welfare of farm animals (39%; 1,275/3,231). The most common concern regarding strictly plant-based pet foods was regarding the nutritional completeness of the diet (74%; 2,439/3,318). Amongst vegans, factors which predicted the feeding of plant-based diets to their pets were concern regarding the cost of plant-based diets, a lack of concern regarding plant-based diets being unnatural, and reporting no concern at all regarding plant-based diets for pets. Given these findings, further research is warranted to investigate plant-based nutrition for domestic dogs and cats.",

We hypothesized that these groups characterized by varying degrees of animal product exclusion have significantly different intakes of many nutrients, with possible implications for dietary adequacy and compliance with population dietary goals. Nutrient intakes were estimated including fortification in foods, but excluding dietary supplements. Dietary supplementation practices were also evaluated. Highly significant differences were found in estimated nutrient intakes between meat eaters and vegans, with fish eaters and vegetarians usually having intermediate values. Meat eaters had the highest energy intakes, followed by fish eaters and vegetarians, whereas vegans had the lowest intakes. Vegans had the highest intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamins C and E, folate, magnesium, iron, and copper. Meat eaters had the highest intake of saturated fatty acids, protein, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, and iodine. Fish eaters had the highest intakes of calcium and selenium. There were no statistically significant differences in sodium and potassium intakes between dietary groups.

Two of the main problems of meat and products during processing and subsequent storage are lipid oxidation and deterioration due to microorganism growth. In this context, several packaging alternatives have been developed by meat industry in order to limit these losses and to extend the meat products´ shelf life. Over the last years, the use of active packaging has been proposed as an alternative to traditional packaging. The principle of active packaging, particularly antioxidant active packaging, consists of including active agents in the packaging which interact with meat and/or its environment, either by trapping pro-oxidant compounds or by releasing antioxidant compounds in order to delay degradation due to lipid oxidation. Therefore, the use of active packaging is presented as a future option to solve the problems derived from oxidative deterioration of meat and meat products. However, its use will depend on the costs involved in the development of this active packaging. Therefore, this review will give an overview about the use of active packaging and natural antioxidants, the active film development techniques, as well as the use of biopolymers as substitutes for synthetic polymers and their direct application in the meat industry.",

While dietary protein plays a key role in the prevention of PEM, it also plays a pivotal role in the environmental impact of the human diet. In search for sustainable dietary strategies to increase protein intake in older adults, this study investigated the readiness of older adults to accept the consumption of the following alternative, more sustainable protein sources: plant-based protein, insects, single-cell protein, and in vitro meat. Using ordinal logistic regression modeling, the associations of different food-related attitudes and behavior and sociodemographics with older adults’ acceptance to consume such protein sources were assessed. Results were obtained through a consumer survey among 1825 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or above in five EU countries (United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Finland). Dairy-based protein was generally the most accepted protein source in food products (75% of the respondents found its consumption acceptable or very acceptable). Plant-based protein was the most accepted alternative, more sustainable protein source (58%) followed by single-cell protein (20%), insect-based protein (9%), and in vitro meat-based protein (6%). We found that food fussiness is a barrier to acceptance, whereas green eating behavior and higher educational attainment are facilitators to older adults’ acceptance to eat protein from alternative, more sustainable sources. Health, sensory appeal, and price as food choice motives, as well as gender and country of residence were found to influence acceptance, although not consistently across all the protein sources. Findings suggest that there is a window of opportunity to increase older adults’ acceptance of alternative, more sustainable protein sources and in turn increase protein intake in an environmentally sustainable way in EU older adults.",

Few studies exist on carcass characteristics of crossbred dairy progeny originating from dairy herds as well as their dams. The objective of the present study was to quantify, using a national database, the carcass characteristics of young animals and cows differing in their fraction of Jersey. The data set consisted of 117,593 young animals and 42,799 cows. The associations between a combination of sire and dam breed proportion (just animal breed proportion when the dependent variable was on cows) with age at slaughter (just for young animals), carcass weight, conformation, fat score, price per kilogram, and total carcass value were estimated using mixed models that accounted for covariances among herdmates of the same sex slaughtered in close proximity in time; we also accounted for age at slaughter in young animals (which was substituted with carcass weight and carcass fat score when the dependent variable was age at slaughter), animal sex, parity of the cow or dam (where relevant), and temporal effects represented by a year-by-month 2-way interaction. For young animals, the heaviest of the dairy carcasses were from the mating of a HolsteinFriesian dam and a Holstein-Friesian sire (323.34 kg), whereas the lightest carcasses were from the mating of a purebred Jersey dam to a purebred Jersey sire which were 46.31 kg lighter (standard error of the difference = 1.21 kg). The young animal carcass weight of an F1 Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross was 20.4 to 27.0 kg less than that of a purebred Holstein-Friesian animal. The carcass conformation of a Holstein-Friesian young animal was 26% superior to that of a purebred Jersey, translating to a difference of 0.78 conformation units on a scale of 1 to 15. Purebred Holstein-Friesians produced carcasses with less fat than their purebred Jersey counterparts. The difference in carcass price per kilogram among the alternative sire-dam breed combinations investigated was minimal, although large differences existed among the different breed types for overall carcass value; the carcass value of a Holstein-Friesian animal was 20% greater than that of a Jersey animal. Purebred Jersey animals required, on average, 21 d longer to reach a given carcass weight and fat score relative to a purebred Holstein-Friesian. The difference in age at slaughter between a purebred Holstein-Friesian animal and the mating between a Holstein-Friesian sire with a Jersey dam, and vice versa, was between 7.0 and 8.9 d. A 75.8-kg difference in carcass weight existed between the carcass of a purebred Jersey cow and that of a Holstein-Friesian cow; a 50% Holstein–Friesian-50% Jersey cow had a carcass 42.0 kg lighter than that of a purebred Holstein-Friesian cow. Carcass conformation was superior in purebred Holstein-Friesian compared with purebred Jersey cows. Results from this study represent useful input parameters to populate simulation models of alternative breeding programs on dairy farms, and to help beef farmers evaluate the cost-benefit of rearing, for slaughter, animals differing in Jersey fraction.",

Consumer samples were drawn from Germany (GER: N = 633) and New Zealand (NZ: N = 445). The samples reflect the underlying age, gender and income distributions. Two separate latent class analyses reveal seven consumer types with five in each country. A large cluster from both countries will not consider substituting meat with legumes or buying processed legume products. Another cluster will consider processed legume products if the products are not marketed as an alternative to meat. Although they do not use them regularly, many consumers in NZ are open to using meat substitutes made from legumes. Another group would prefer to directly substitute meat with specific legumes rather than having highly processed products.

In this context, the present study was undertaken to compare the meat quality, composition, and consumer preference of slow-growing and commercial white broiler chicken meats. Commercial white broilers (vencobb strain) used in this study weighed approximately 2.0 kg and are 36 days old. The slow-growing birds were from Indbro strain which is multicolored and costing about 30 to 50% higher price in local markets. The dressing percentage, breast meat yield, meat bone ratio, and muscle fiber diameter were higher (P < 0.05) in commercial broilers. However, the cooking yield of drumstick and breast meat did not differ significantly between 2 genotypes. Shear force value and protein content of thigh meat were higher (P < 0.05) in slowgrowing broiler as compared to the commercial broiler. Slow-growing boiler breast meat contains significantly (P < 0.05) lower total fatty acid and saturated fatty acid content. A significant (P < 0.05) percentage (67%) of consumers preferred the meat and meat products prepared from slow-growing broiler meat. During “paired comparison” test the semi-trained panelists could able to differentiate between slow-growing and fast-growing broiler meat.

Selection and consumption varied by race, ethnicity, gender, and eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. For example, black students consumed fewer calories than white students, black and Hispanic students consumed fewer calories from milk than white students, and free and reduced-price lunch eligible students consumed more calories from milk and fewer calories from grains. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we determine that school lunches are an important part of school-day food intake for NSLP participants. These results provide guidance for making changes within a cafeteria’s offerings to increase the selection of healthy foods.",

        "abstract": "Efforts to reduce plate-waste (PW) are limited to those by a dietitian who serves the entire school rather than a better characterization of individuals who are served. We tested the hypothesis that children reporting habitual PW would have different physical or dietary characteristics compared with children without PW. Participants were 407 children aged 6 to 9 years in elementary schools in Kyeonggi, Korea. Information on eating behavior and food preference was collected using a questionnaire administered by parents. Among them, 91 students participated further in anthropometry, step counting, taste acuity tests, and nutrition intake from school lunches. Participants were divided into tertiles according to total frequency of leaving PW from each meal on a typical day: no PW, moderate PW, and habitual PW. Children with habitual PW showed several undesirable characteristics: consuming less of various vegetables, eating only what they like, poor table manners, and frequent consumption of street foods and cookies/beverages/fast foods. Whereas height, weight, and obesity index as well as taste acuity and daily steps in the habitual PW group were not significantly different, intakes of potassium, niacin, and folate were significantly lower compared with the other groups. Therefore, habitual PW did not seem to result from having a lower energy requirement or different taste acuity, or result in observed slowed growth, but it could place children at a risk for insufficient nutritional intake, consequently impairing growth and general health. The results emphasize the parental role in shaping children's diet and provide information for developing strategies to reduce PW of individual children.",

        "abstract": "Background There are currently no national standards for school lunch period length and little is known about the association between the amount of time students have to eat and school food selection and consumption. Objective Our aim was to examine plate-waste measurements from students in the control arm of the Modifying Eating and Lifestyles at School study (2011 to 2012 school year) to determine the association between amount of time to eat and school meal selection and consumption. Design We used a prospective study design using up to six repeated measures among students during the school year. Participants/setting One thousand and one students in grades 3 to 8 attending six participating elementary and middle schools in an urban, low-income school district where lunch period lengths varied from 20 to 30 minutes were included. Main outcome measures School food selection and consumption were collected using plate-waste methodology. Statistical analyses performed Logistic regression and mixed-model analysis of variance was used to examine food selection and consumption. Results Compared with meal-component selection when students had at least 25 minutes to eat, students were significantly less likely to select a fruit (44% vs 57%; P<0.0001) when they had <20 minutes to eat. There were no significant differences in entrée, milk, or vegetable selections. Among those who selected a meal component, students with <20 minutes to eat consumed 13% less of their entrée (P<0.0001), 10% less of their milk (P<0.0001), and 12% less of their vegetable (P<0.0001) compared with students who had at least 25 minutes to eat. Conclusions During the school year, a substantial number of students had insufficient time to eat, which was associated with significantly decreased entrée, milk, and vegetable consumption compared with students who had more time to eat. School policies that encourage lunches with at least 25 minutes of seated time might reduce food waste and improve dietary intake.",

        "abstract": "Background: The U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently made substantial changes to the school meal standards. The media and public outcry have suggested that this has led to substantially more food waste. Purpose: School meal selection, consumption, and waste were assessed before and after implementation of the new school meal standards. Methods: Plate waste data were collected in four schools in an urban, low-income school district. Logistic regression and mixed-model ANOVA were used to estimate the differences in selection and consumption of school meals before (fall 2011) and after implementation (fall 2012) of the new standards among 1030 elementary and middle school children. Analyses were conducted in 2013. Results: After the new standards were implemented, fruit selection increased by 23.0% and entrée and vegetable selection remained unchanged. Additionally, post-implementation entrée consumption increased by 15.6%, vegetable consumption increased by 16.2%, and fruit consumption remained the same. Milk selection and consumption decreased owing to an unrelated milk policy change. Conclusions: Although food waste levels were substantial both pre- and post-implementation, the new guidelines have positively affected school meal selection and consumption. Despite the increased vegetable portion size requirement, consumption increased and led to significantly more cups of vegetables consumed. Significantly more students selected a fruit, whereas the overall percentage of fruit consumed remained the same, resulting in more students consuming fruits. Contrary to media reports, these results suggest that the new school meal standards have improved students’ overall diet quality. Legislation to weaken the standards is not warranted.",

        "abstract": "From 2006 to 2010, deforestation in the Amazon frontier state of Mato Grosso decreased to 30% of its historical average (1996– 2005) whereas agricultural production reached an all-time high. This study combines satellite data with government deforestation and production statistics to assess land-use transitions and potential market and policy drivers associated with these trends. In the forested region of the state, increased soy production from 2001 to 2005 was entirely due to cropland expansion into previously cleared pasture areas (74%) or forests (26%). From 2006 to 2010, 78% of production increases were due to expansion (22% to yield increases), with 91% on previously cleared land. Cropland expansion fell from 10 to 2% of deforestation between the two periods, with pasture expansion accounting for most remaining deforestation. Declining deforestation coincided with a collapse of commodity markets and implementation of policy measures to reduce deforestation. Soybean profitability has since increased to pre2006 levels whereas deforestation continued to decline, suggesting that antideforestation measures may have influenced the agricultural sector. We found little evidence of direct leakage of soy expansion into cerrado in Mato Grosso during the late 2000s, although indirect land-use changes and leakage to more distant regions are possible. This study provides evidence that reduced deforestation and increased agricultural production can occur simultaneously in tropical forest frontiers, provided that land is available and policies promote the efficient use of already-cleared lands (intensification) while restricting deforestation. It remains uncertain whether government- and industry-led policies can contain deforestation if future market conditions favor another boom in agricultural expansion.",

        "abstract": "Amazon beef and soybean industries, the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation, are increasingly responsive to economic signals emanating from around the world, such as those associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, “mad cow disease”) outbreaks and China’s economic growth. The expanding role of these economic “teleconnections” (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3-year period (2002–2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large-scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship—including compliance with legislation—may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of “losing” their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society. The foot-and-mouth eradication system, in which geographic zones win permission to export beef, may provide an important model for the design of a low-cost, peer-enforced, socioenvironmental certification system that becomes the mechanism by which beef and soy industries gain access to markets outside the Amazon.",

However, organic farming is growing worldwide and basic information about genetic parameters is needed for future breeding strategies for organic dairy farming. The goal of this study was to estimate heritabilities of milk production traits under organic farming conditions and to estimate the magnitude of G×E between organic and conventional dairy farming. For this purpose, production records of firstparity Holstein heifers were used. Heritabilities of milk, fat and protein yield, and somatic cell score (SCS) were higher under organic farming conditions. For percentages of fat and protein, heritabilities of organic and conventional production were very similar. Genetic correlations between preorganic and organic, and organic and conventional milk production were 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. For fat yield, these correlations were 0.86 and 0.88, and for protein yield, these were 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. Our findings indicate that moderate G×E was present for yield traits. For percentage of fat and protein and SCS, genetic correlations between organic and conventional and preorganic production were close to unity, indicating that there was no G×E for these traits.",

        "abstract": "Milk production in Malawi is stagnating while steadily increasing in neighboring countries. We performed a literature review to identify factors negatively affecting milk production in Malawi and propose potential solutions to overcome the particular constraints. We structured the analysis along the value chain with three major components: upstream providers, on-farm production, and downstream providers. It is shown that the literature strongly focuses on on-farm constraints and most prominently on animal health, breed choice, and milk yield. The literature research did not reveal any reasons specific to Malawi that would hinder an increase in milk production as experienced in neighboring countries. We suggest a focus on crossbreeds accompanied by local breeding programs, which would reduce dependence on imported semen and strengthen the currently unreliable artificial insemination services. In addition, crossbreeds may be better suited than pure breeds for current feeding practices and climate conditions and thus come close to reaching their genetic potential. We conclude that cost advantages of crossbreeds clearly compensate for the lower revenues compared with exotic breeds such as Holstein-Friesian or Jersey",

        "abstract": "The worldwide population in 2067 will reach 10.4 billion with 81% residing in Africa or Asia. Arable land available for food production will decrease to 0.15 ha per person. Temperature will increase in tropical and temperate zones, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and this will push growing seasons and dairy farming away from arid areas and into more northern latitudes. Dairy consumption will increase because it provides essential nutrients more efficiently than many other agricultural systems. Dairy farming will become modernized in developing countries and milk production per cow will increase, doubling in countries with advanced dairying systems. Profitability of dairy farms will be the key to their sustainability. Genetic improvements will include emphasis on the coding genome and associated noncoding epigenome of cattle, and on microbiomes of dairy cattle and farmsteads. Farm sizes will increase and there will be greater lateral integration of housing and management of dairy cattle of different ages and production stages. Integrated sensors, robotics, and automation will replace much of the manual labor on farms. Managing the epigenome and microbiome will become part of routine herd management. Innovations in dairy facilities will improve the health of cows and permit expression of natural behaviors. Herds will be viewed as superorganisms, and studies of herds as observational units will lead to improvements in productivity, health, and well-being of dairy cattle, and improve the agroecology and sustainability of dairy farms. Dairy farmers in 2067 will meet the world’s needs for essential nutrients by adopting technologies and practices that provide improved cow health and longevity, profitable dairy farms, and sustainable agriculture.",

The objective of this invited review paper is to give that scientific background and determine whether Big Data has overcome the peak of inflated expectations. A conceptual model was created, and a literature search in Scopus resulted in 1442 scientific peer reviewed papers. After thorough screening on relevance and classification by the authors, 142 papers remained for further analysis. The area of precision dairy farming (with classes in the primary chain (dairy farm, feed, breed, health, food, retail, consumer) and levels for object of interest (animal, farm, network)), the Big Data-V area (with categories on Volume, Velocity, Variety and other V’s) and the data analytics area (with categories in analysis methods (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised classification, reinforcement learning) and data characteristics (time-series, streaming, sequence, graph, spatial, multimedia)) were analysed. The animal sublevel, with 83% of the papers, exceeds the farm sublevel and network sublevel. Within the animal sublevel, topics within the dairy farm level prevailed with 58% over the health level (33%). Within the Big Data category, the Volume category was most favoured with 59% of the papers, followed by 37% of papers that included the Variety category. None of the papers included the Velocity category. Supervised learning, representing 87% of the papers, exceeds unsupervised learning (12%). Within supervised learning, 64% of the papers dealt with classification issues and exceeds the regression methods (36%). Time-series were used in 61% of the papers and were mostly dealing with animal-based farm data. Multimedia data appeared in a greater number of recent papers. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Big Data is a relevant topic of research within the precision dairy farming area, but that the full potential of Big Data in this precision dairy farming area is not utilised yet. However, the present authors expect the full potential of Big Data, within the precision dairy farming area, will be reached when multiple Big Data characteristics (Volume, Variety and other V’s) and sources (animal, groups, farms and chain parts) are used simultaneously, adding value to operational and strategic decision",

        "abstract": "Dairy small ruminants account for approximately 21% of all sheep and goats in the world, produce around 3.5% of the world’s milk, and are mainly located in subtropical-temperate areas of Asia, Europe, and Africa. Dairy sheep are concentrated around the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, where their dairy products are typical ingredients of the human diet. Dairy goats are concentrated in low-income, fooddeficit countries of the Indian subcontinent, where their products are a key food source, but are also present in high-income, technologically developed countries. This review evaluates the status of the dairy sheep and goat sectors in the world, with special focus on the commercially and technically developed industries in France, Greece, Italy, and Spain (FGIS). Dairy small ruminants account for a minor part of the total agricultural output in France, Italy, and Spain (0.9 to 1.8%) and a larger part in Greece (8.8%). In FGIS, the dairy sheep industry is based on local breeds and crossbreeds raised under semi-intensive and intensive systems and is concentrated in a few regions in these countries. Average flock size varies from small to medium (140 to 333 ewes/farm), and milk yield from low to medium (85 to 216 L/ewe), showing substantial room for improvement. Most sheep milk is sold to industries and processed into traditional cheese types, many of which are Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) cheeses for gourmet and export markets (e.g., Pecorino, Manchego, and Roquefort). By comparing break-even milk price among FGIS countries, we observed the following: (1) most Greek and French dairy sheep farms were unprofitable, with the exception of the intensive Chios farms of Greece; (2) milk price was aligned with cost of production in Italy; and (3) profitable farms coexisted with unprofitable farms in Spain. In FGIS, dairy goat production is based on local breeds raised under more extensive systems than sheep. Compared with sheep, average dairy goat herds are smaller (36 to 190 does/ farm) but milk yield is greater (153 to 589 L/doe), showing room for improvement. Goat milk is mainly processed on-farm into dairy products for national markets, but some PDO goat milk cheeses (e.g., Murcia al Vino) are exported. Processed goat milk is sold for local human consumption or dehydrated for export. Mixed sheep-goat (e.g., Feta) and cow-sheep-goat milk cheeses are common in many countries. Strategies to improve the dairy sheep and goat sectors in these 4 countries are proposed and discussed. Key words: milk, dairy",

Thirty ceca were collected at slaughter from batches of broilers from 789 flocks, at either full or partial depopulation, between December 2003 and March 2006 and examined individually for Campylobacter by direct plating onto selective media. Management and health data were collected from each flock and included information on mortality or culling during rearing, the number of birds rejected for infectious or noninfectious causes at slaughter, the proportion of birds with digital dermatitis (also termed hock burn), and other general characteristics of the flock. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 280 (35%) flocks. The relationship between bird health and welfare and Campylobacter status of flocks was assessed using random-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for region, month, year, and rearing regime. Campylobacter-positive batches of ceca were associated with higher levels of rejection due to infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI95%], 0.98 to 2.30) and digital dermatitis (OR, 2.08; CI95%, 1.20 to 3.61). Furthermore, higher levels of these conditions were also associated with the highest-level category of withinflock Campylobacter prevalence (70 to 100%).

Recent evidence suggests that the minimum infective oral dose for 100% caecal colonization is about 104 cfu, which, with such a 'fragile' organism, may limit transmissibility. However, the colonization potential of laboratory-adapted strains may be anomalous compared with fresh isolates or those passaged in vivo. The colonization potential of two chicken and one human C. jejuni isolates, which were minimally passaged, have been investigated using a quantitative model of chicken colonization. There was no detectable difference between these strains but all were more efficient colonizers than a laboratory-adapted strain 81116. In addition, the colonization potential of C. jejuni strain 81116 following a passage in vivo was also determined. The results indicated this increased c. 10000 fold following a single passage in vivo, such that a dose of only 40 cfu caused maximal colonization. Enhanced colonization potential may, therefore, account for the rapid rate of transmission within large flocks.",

However, the interaction of Campylobacter with intestinal epithelial cells and its effects on the intestinal function of chickens are poorly studied. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of C. jejuni oral infection on the mRNA expression of nutrient transporters in the intestine. Newly hatched specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were orally infected with C. jejuni (NCTC 12744; 1 108 CFU/bird) at 14 days of age. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses at 14 days-post infection (dpi) revealed that the relative gene expression of the sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) and the peptide transporter (PepT-1) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in all investigated segments (duodenum, jejunum and cecum) of Campylobacter-infected birds, while the facilitated glucose transporter (GLUT-2) was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in jejunal and cecal tissues only. Furthermore, down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT-2) and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-3) was seen in the jejunum, and down-regulation (P < 0.05) of the L-type amino acid transporter (y+ LAT-2) was noticed in the duodenum of infected birds. The decreased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters coincided with a decrease (P < 0.05) in body weight and body weight gain during a 2-week post infection period. For the first time, it can be concluded that nutrient transporter expression is compromised in the small and large intestine of Campylobacter-infected birds with negative consequences on growth performance.

        "abstract": "During the past few years, entomophagy has been increasing in significance. As insects are generally high in protein, they are principally considered as meat substitutes. Nevertheless, in Western countries, meat substitute consumption is actually very low, principally due to food neophobia and poor sensory qualities in comparison with meat. In insect particular case, food neophobia is clearly high. To reduce insect food neophobia, previous studies suggest to insert invisible insect in food preparation and/or to associate them with known flavors. In this study, a survey on entomophagy perception and hedonic tests were realized to assess the level of sensory-liking of hybrid insect-based burgers (beef, lentils, mealworms and beef, mealworms and lentils). Participants’ overall liking of the four burgers differed between genders and was influenced by burger appearance and taste. Women clearly preferred beef burger appearance, whereas men preferred the appearance of beef and insect-based burgers. Concerning insect-based burger taste, participants (men and women) rated it intermediately, between that of the beef and lentil burger, with a preference for the mealworm and beef burger. Results also showed that people with previous entomophagy experience was limited but that they gave globally higher ratings to all preparations. In conclusion, insect tasting sessions are important to decrease food neophobia, as they encourage people to ‘‘take the first step” and become acquainted with entomophagy. Nevertheless, insect integration into Western food culture will involve a transitional phase with minced or powdered insects incorporated into ready-to-eat preparations, as people are not ready to add insects to their diets in ‘‘whole form.”",

Previous research on consumers' meat choices has mainly focused on meat species, while consumer preferences for meat cuts has so far only received limited interest. The aim of this study is to shed some light into this relatively unexplored area by answering four research questions. First, this study intends to show the relative importance meat cuts play in relation to other extrinsic product attributes. Secondly, this paper looks into differences in choice criteria between regular and special occasions. Third, consumer segments that differ in their preferences and beef purchase are identified, and, finally, the meat purchase portfolios of these segments are revealed. A stated preference methodology of a discrete choice experiment with cut-specific prices covering several meat cuts simultaneously is proposed to answer the research questions. The sample consists of 1500 respondents representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender and geographic location The results shows that meat cut is the most important factor when choosing bovine meat followed by quality certification (origin), production technique, the type of breed and price. In terms of consumption occasions, we observe significantly lower price sensitivity for marbled steaks and cutlets for special occasions compared to normal occasions. Segmentation analysis shows that while the choices of two segments (comprising about 40% of the sample) are mostly driven by extrinsic product attributes, the remaining segments are mostly driven by meat cuts. These varying preferences are also reflected in the purchase portfolios of the different segments, while less variability is detected from a socio-demographic perspective",

Understanding the factors that drive their desire to eat is key to limiting their reactions to available food. This study tested whether individual differences in sensitivity to hedonic food cues are cognitively based and, accordingly, can be regulated by blocking cognitive resources. To this end, one lab study (Study 1; N ¼ 91) and one field study (Study 2; N ¼ 63) measured sensitivity to hedonic food cues using the Power of Food Scale (PFS; Lowe et al., 2009) and assessed participants' appetitive responses to high-calorie food options. To test the role of cognitive elaboration of food cues, participants completed a menu-selection task to induce food cravings and then were free to elaborate those cravings (control group) or were blocked from idng so by cognitive distraction (playing Tetris, solving puzzles; experimental group). Compared to non-sensitive participants, sensitive participants displayed a greater attentional bias to high-calorie food (Study 1), reported stronger cravings (Study 2), and more often chose an unhealthy snack (Studies 1 & 2), but only when they had not been distracted. When distracted, all participants were similarly unresponsive to high-calorie food.

Intraclass correlation coefficients were interpreted as moderate over the 18-month period for both the Diagnosis [ICC = .71, 95% CI (.45, .88)] and Symptom scores [ICC = .72, 95% CI (.58, .82)]. YFAS assessed food addiction Diagnosis and Symptom scores were found to be relatively stable over 18-months in a non-clinical population of predominantly female, young adults. Future research is required to determine the impact of behavioural weight loss interventions on YFAS assessed addictive-like eating",

        "title": "Data science as a language: challenges for computer science-a position paper",
        "abstract": "In this paper, I posit that from a research point of view, Data Science is a language. More precisely Data Science is idng Science using computer science as a language for datafied sciences; much as mathematics is the language of, e.g., physics. From this viewpoint, three (classes) of challenges for computer science are identified; complementing the challenges the closely related Big Data problem already poses to computer science. I discuss the challenges with references to, in my opinion, related, interesting directions in computer science research; note, I claim neither that these directions are the most appropriate to solve the challenges nor that the cited references represent the best work in their field, they are inspirational to me. So, what are these challenges? Firstly, if computer science is to be a language, what should that language look like? While our traditional specifications such as pseudocode are an excellent way to convey what has been done, they fail for more mathematics like reasoning about computations. Secondly, if computer science is to function as a foundation of other, datafied, sciences, its own foundations should be in order. While we have excellent foundations for supervised learning-e.g., by having loss functions to optimize and, more general, by PAC learning (Valiant in Commun ACM 27(11):1134-1142, 1984)-this is far less true for unsupervised learning. Kolmogorov complexity-or, more general, Algorithmic Information Theory-provides a solid base (Li and Vitányi in An introduction to Kolmogorov complexity and its applications, Springer, Berlin, 1993). It provides an objective criterion to choose between competing hypotheses, but it lacks, e.g., an objective measure of the uncertainty of a discovery that datafied sciences need. Thirdly, datafied sciences come with new conceptual challenges. Data-driven scientists come up with data analysis questions that sometimes do and sometimes don't, fit our conceptual toolkit. Clearly, computer science does not suffer from a lack of interesting, deep, research problems. However, the challenges posed by data science point to a large reservoir of untapped problems. Interesting, stimulating problems, not in the least because they are posed by our colleagues in datafied sciences. It is an exciting time to be a computer scientist.",
