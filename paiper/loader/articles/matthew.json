        "title": "Effects of Maillard-reacted beef bone hydrolysate on the physicochemical properties of extruded meat alternatives",
        "abstract": "Meat analogues are made from plant proteins using high-moisture extrusion processing, to have the same textural and structural properties as meat. However, meat analogues exhibit very weak aroma and are almost tasteless, which has resulted in limited market success. Maillard-reacted beef bone hydrolysate (MRP) provides important sensory aspects of heat-treated food products, by contributing to their appearance, texture, flavor, and aroma. Therefore, MRP added at different concentrations with the plant proteins before extrusion may produce meat alternatives with high aroma and taste quality while maintaining fibrous structure. This study investigated the effects of MRP at different concentrations (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% wet weight) with plant proteins on the physicochemical properties of extruded meat alternatives. The textural, microstructural, chemical, and sensory properties of meat alternatives were studied, where meat alternatives consisting of 40% MRP showed the lowest degree of texturization and observed with multiple segmented layers accompanied with some fibrous microstructure. Results from protein solubility analysis suggested that a large proportion of aggregated proteins was associated with hydrogen bonds. Although the key force in the formation of fibrous structure in meat alternatives was disulphide bonds. Meat alternatives containing 20% MRP obtained highest sensory scores for appearance, meaty aroma, meaty taste, and overall acceptability. Overall results showed that the addition of MRP to produce meat alternatives changed the textural, structural, and sensory properties significantly.",

        "abstract": "The production of meat analogs using high moisture extrusion cooking is a complex process that depends on the properties of the protein ingredients. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different moisture and wheat gluten contents on the retention of volatile flavor substances,  microstructure, moisture distribution, and secondary protein structures of meat analogs produced by the high moisture extrusion process. The high moisture extrusion trials were carried out using a soy protein concentrate with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30, and 40% added wheat gluten (by dry mass) or 50%, 60%, 70, and 80% moisture. The comparisons revealed that the retention rates of volatile flavor substances from large to small were generally represented by esters, alkanes, alkenes, phenols, aldehydes, and alcohols, under the same extrusion conditions. The wheat gluten and moisture contents affected the flavor characteristics of the meat analogs by affecting the microstructure, the binding capacity of internal proteins and water molecules, and the secondary structure of the proteins. The higher retention rates of the volatile flavor substances were observed in meat analogs produced by raw material with higher wheat gluten content and lower moisture content. Our findings show that wheat gluten and moisture contents of the raw material regulate the retention rate of volatile flavor substances by affecting the microstructure, water distribution, protein structure, and interactive force of the meat analogs, opening up a wide range of products for different consumer requirements.",

        "title": "Towards More Sustainable Meat Alternatives: How Technical Parameters Affect the Sensory Properties of Extrusion Products Derived from Soy and Algae",
        "abstract": "High moisture extrusion cooking is a well-established method to develop soy-based meat alternatives. Algae are increasingly researched into as an alternative protein source, particularly the micro-algae spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is known for its high protein content. However, little is known how spirulina behaves during the extrusion process. This study investigates the sensory properties of spirulina (10%, 30% or 50%) and soy-based meat alternatives (16 samples) produced according to a Design of Experiment (DoE) with different levels of moisture (57%, 67% or 77%), screw speed (600 rpm, 900 rpm or 1200 rpm), temperature (140 °C, 160 °C or 180 °C) and two production days (independent replicates). Conventional profiling by a trained sensory panel (n = 12) based on a product-specific vocabulary was carried out and the samples were also subjected to instrumental texture profile analysis (TPA) and razor shear measurement (MORS). The data revealed that high spirulina content caused a black color, an intense flavor with earthy notes and an algae odor that is rather musty. Additionally, the higher the share of spirulina, the lower were the elasticity, fibrousness and firmness of extruded samples. High moisture content resulted in products evoking a juicy and soft mouthfeel plus a moist appearance. Instrumentally measured texture parameters matched with the sensory profile regarding texture: high moisture induces a decrease in shear force, shear energy, hardness, cohesion, springiness and chewiness. Particularly firmness perceived by the panel correlates with both MORS and TPA measurements while sensory elasticity correlates with springiness. When keeping moisture low, but screw speed and temperature high during extrusion, it is possible to partly substitute soy with spirulina in order to produce firm and fibrous products with a decent algae flavor that will contribute to shape a more sustainable future for food.",

        "abstract": "The concept of shear-induced structuring was applied to concentrated blends of soy protein isolate (SPI) and wheat gluten (WG) to create novel semi-solid food textures. Concurrent simple shear deformation and heating (95 °C) of the protein blends generated original structures consisting of fibers or layers. The ratio of SPI to vital WG and the final concentration determined the morphology of the structure. It is hypothesized that the spatial distribution of the SPI-rich phase and the WG-rich phase in a blend was altered by the shear flow. When both phases became aligned horizontally in the shear cell, a fibrous structure was formed; when they became aligned vertically in the shear cell, a layered structure was formed. The structures obtained were analyzed visually and using texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy.",

A higher SME resulted in extrudates with lower L* but higher a* , DE, higher tensile strength, and hardness. The viscosity of dough at die decreased from 997.17 to 867.29 Pa s when SME increased from 819.70 to 1258.70 kJ/kg. The increasing SME also caused an increase of protein solubility in phosphate buffer solution by 15.30%. Increasing the SME resulted in higher content of low Mw subunits as well, which was evidenced by SDS–PAGE. It was concluded that increasing SME increased the proportion of smaller fractions, and led to darker and higher tensile strength products.",

        "abstract": "Soybean protein isolate (SPI) was extruded using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder at low (28%) and high (60%) moisture content. Dead-stop operation was employed to obtain samples from different zones of the extruder. The protein solubility of extrudate was analyzed based on 8 different combinations of chemical bond-breaking solutions, which contained only phosphate buffer (P); two reagents, i.e. sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in P (P þ S), urea in P (P þ U) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) in P (P þ M); three reagents, i.e. (P þ S þ U), (P þ U þ M) and (P þ M þ S); four reagents, i.e. (P þ S þ U þ M). Based on the protein solubility in the combined extraction solutions, each specific chemical bond and their interactions responsible for supporting the extrudate structure were further analyzed. The aggregation of protein subunits in extruded sample was investigated by using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The results showed that hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and their interactions collectively hold the structure of extrudate; and the importance of non-covalent bonds outweighs covalent bonds. Increasing feed moisture content could increase the interactions between disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds and between disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions (p < 0.05), reduce the degree of aggregation and the difference in proteineprotein interactions and protein subunits among different zones within the extruder.",

        "abstract": "Soy protein-based materials modified with gelatin, lactose and sucrose were prepared by extrusion at low moisture content. The effect of composition on the extrusion parameters was investigated and specific mechanical energy (SME) was measured as an indication of extrusion processability, thus providing good characterization of the extrusion process in order to make it highly energy efficient and cost effective. Water content was the most important factor on the extrusion parameters and product properties. The incorporation of gelatin increased SME and the product obtained at the extruder die was not continuous. However, when lactose was added, SME decreased and the color of the product changed due to Maillard reaction. This reaction could be analyzed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) where the changes of the amide I and amide II bands reflected that hydroxyl groups in sugars and amino groups in soy protein isolate (SPI) were consumed during extrusion. These results are in good agreement with total soluble matter (TSM) values, which were lower for mixtures with lactose than sucrose due to a higher degree of Maillard reaction. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results also showed the influence of Maillard reaction, which lead to more ordered and compact structures, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study the effect of three hydration regimens on the extent of matrix transformation, texture, microstructure and digestibility of a corn-based extruded product blended with apple pomace. Blends containing 0%, 17%, 22%, and 28% pomace were hydrated to 17.2% by adding water either into the preconditioner (P), the extruder (E) or dividing half in each (PE). Increasing the opportunity for hydration (P > PE > E) promoted more complete starch gelatinization at all pomace levels. Apple pomace promoted milder extrusion conditions, resulting in less starch gelatinization and solubilization, poor expansion and reduced starch digestibility. Digestible starch was inversely correlated to cell wall thickness/cell size ratio (r = 0.91), which increased with pomace addition. Thus, pomace decreased digestibility by promoting changes in structure and gelatinization. Delayed water addition (E) promoted broader cell size and cell wall thickness distributions, attributed to poor mixing and hydration. Therefore, water incorporation (not just total content) is a key factor in defining extrudate microstructure, texture and digestibility patterns.",

        "abstract": "Whole wheat is well known by consumers as a health-providing ingredient. Nevertheless, in extruded products it leads to textures that are less favorable to consumer preference compared to its refined flour. An understanding of the effect of extrusion on whole wheat properties is therefore necessary to improve its texture. Whole wheat flour was extruded under varying conditions of water content (18 or 22%), screw speed (400 or 800 rpm) and barrel temperature (140 or 180 \u0001C) and its physicochemical properties were measured. Changing the extrusion conditions significantly modified the volumetric expansion index (between 9.1 and 20.6) and longitudinal expansion (between 0.93 and 2.98) of the samples. Interestingly, changing the extrusion conditions did not significantly modify the sectional expansion. Increasing barrel temperature, water content or screw speed decreased the shear viscosity of the melt. This can be explained by plasticizing effects and modification of starch properties. The change in shear viscosity at the die can mostly explain the effect of process conditions on volumetric expansion of the extruded whole wheat. The stress at rupture of the extruded samples was varied between 0.49 and 1.86 MPa depending on process conditions. It was the lowest at high water content and low screw speed",

In general, the greater the extent of acylation, the greater the improvement in emulsification properties compared to the untreated protein isolate; however, improvement at greater than 3.0 mmol anhydride/g protein was slight, Acetylation at 3 mmol/g increased foam capacity to the greatest extent. Water adsorption was enhanced to the greatest extent in protein isolates acetylated at 5 mmol/g.

        "abstract": "Alternatives to animal proteins with similar texture, appearance and taste are demanded by an increasing group of consumers. Plant-based meat analogues produced by high moisture extrusion cooking can provide relevant solutions. Here, microalgae combined to soy concentrates were shown to create fibrillary textured extrudates. The incorporation of spray-dried microalgae biomass in up to 50% affected the formation of fibers, which could be balanced by reducing moisture levels. The elevated fat content of microalgae biomass led to lubrication effects, while probably undisrupted microalgae cells acted as passive fillers and limited the access of intracellular proteins. Both effects may have reduced texturing but increased tenderness in comparison to pure soy based extrudates. By using heterotrophically cultivated Auxenochlorella protothecoides with a light-yellow coloration, a consumer-adverse visual appearance could be omitted. Microalgae integration improved the extrudate's nutritional profile by incorporating vitamins B and E, where over 95% was retained in the final product. Industrial relevance: The meat analogue industry strives to be more than an alternative for vegetarian and vegan customers. Large initial public offerings of relevant players underline the current economic and industrial interest. Besides animal wellbeing, meat analogues are praised mainly for their reduced ecological and environmental impact. Yet, most of the products on the market are based on environmentally questionable resources, such as soy. Hence, this study with focus on microalgae as a protein alternative to the ubiquitously applied soy protein concentrate is relevant to the evolving industry and research. In this manuscript, a fibrillary textured plant-based product using microalgae is shown without an adverse color.",

        "abstract": "Fibrous macrostructures can be obtained from among others soy protein isolate (SPI) - wheat gluten (WG) blends, when deformed with simple shear flow while heating. This SPI-WG blend consists of two phases, which are separated on a micrometer scale. The properties, especially the rheological properties, of SPI- and WG-phases determine the structure formation process largely. The objective of this study was to determine the properties of the phases present in SPI-WG blends using conditions relevant for fibrous structure formation. Since, the rheological properties are dependent on the concentration of each protein in its respective phase, we determined the water content in the two phases with a methodology based on time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance. The spatial distribution of the two phases was studied with confocal scanning laser microscopy, and the rheological properties were measured with three types of oscillatory rheology. The experiments showed that the SPI-phase absorbed more water than the WG-phase, which resulted in a larger volume fraction than mass fraction of the SPI-phase and vice versa for WG. The absorption of more water by SPI resulted in a lower concentration of SPI in that phase, remarkably leading to a G′-value for SPI that was similar to the rheological properties of WG. Similarities in rheological properties seem to be required to strongly deform and align the dispersed phase and form fibrous macrostructures.",

An optimum in shape anisotropy of the air and pectin droplets, and mechanical anisotropy was found for a shear rate of 39 s\u00011 . At higher shear rates, air was expelled and break-up of pectin droplets was found, resulting in materials with hardly any mechanical anisotropy. There was discrepancy between the modeled and experimental data when using the same mass fraction and volume fraction of pectin, whereas the model fitted better when assuming that the pectin phase absorbs more water relatively to the soy phase.",

Expressible moisture and cooking yield were decreased and textural properties, such as cutting force and elasticity, were increased significantly upon the addition of ICGN. Scanning electron microscopic observations showed that increasing ICGN levels led to a more compact network in the meat analogues supporting the changes obtained in texture, cooking yield, and expressible moisture. Sensory evaluation results confirmed that the increase in ICGN concentration led to harder, more fibrous and less juicy products resulting in a significantly improved overall acceptance.

We here want to obtain more information of the internal structure of pea protein-gluten and soy proteingluten blends, by using the polymer blending law to explain rheological responses. For this polymer blending law the water distribution over the two phases is the blend was obtained with time domain 1H NMR measurements using the NMR measurements of individual protein phases and on the blend. By matching the relaxation rate (R2) of the individual phases with those of the blend, the water distribution over the two phases could be obtained. Water is preferentially taken up by the soy or pea protein phase leaving less water for gluten, which effect strongly changes the volume fractions of the phases. Rheological properties of the separate phases as function of their hydration resulted in higher apparent modulus for the wheat gluten phase, and a lower one for the pea and soy protein phase. From the results, it was concluded that both blends show signs of a bi-continuous morphology. The SPI-WG blend showed an intermediate value between bi-continuous and SPI continuous. PPI-WG at lower temperatures showed a bi-continuous structure, while at higher processing temperatures and time was probably WG continuous.",

Our find‐ ings reveal that the desired meat analog with high potential in physicochemical and functional characteristics under intermediate moisture extrusion among TVPs is IPP‐ based TVP. Practical applications It is well‐known that soybean protein and wheat gluten (WG) were widely used for producing a texturized vegetable protein (TVP). However, soybean protein and WG have limitations as food allergen and imbalance of essential amino acids, respectively. Thus, mung bean protein, peanut protein, and pea protein were chosen for this study. From the results, it could be possible to develop a new generation of TVP from pea protein instead of soybean protein and WG for future human diets.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of low moisture extrusion cooking on the structural changes of protein and expansion properties, a pea protein isolate was processed in a twin screw extruder at varying screw speed (400-700 min−1), moisture content (26–35%) and barrel temperature (130–170 °C). An expanded protein isolate matrix was achieved for a specific mechanical energy input above 180 kJ/kg and product temperatures above 130 °C. The expanded protein network was presumably stabilized by increased protein aggregation, which most likely was formed by α-helices, β-sheet, non-covalently bonded β-turn or anti-parallel β-sheet structures as identified by FTIR. SDS-PAGE suggested, that neither the vicilin nor the convicilin fraction of the protein were altered, whereas legumin was either proteolysed or aggregated. Processing reduced the protein’s water solubility. This knowledge contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural changes in a pea protein isolate as caused by low moisture extrusion.",

Twin-screw extrusion cooking of peas showed the dependence of proteinaceous ANF (such as trypsin inhibitors and lectins) on the processing variables used.

The costs of extrusion vary considerably according to the processing conditions and are confined to the desired objectives of extrusion cooking. The objectives, in terms of the inactivation rates for pea ANF. must therefore, be clearly defined and based on threshold levels established from experiments with monogastric animals.

At these conditions, anisotropy occurred with increased extrusion temperature. Compared to untreated SPC, no change in protein-protein interactions occurred for extruded samples. Applying a Closed Cavity Rheometer allowed investigating the influence of defined thermomechanical treatment on rheological properties. Increasing thermal treatment had a pronounced influence on flow behavior, causing a decrease in complex viscosity.

However, comparisons of product properties and mechanisms applied in the production of low- and high-moisture meat analogues have not been reported. In this study, the effects of extrusion types (low- and high-moisture extrusion cooking), absence or presence of added wheat gluten, as well as screw speed (150 and 200 rpm) on the physicochemical properties of meat analogues were evaluated. The mechanism of protein texturization of low- and high-moisture meat analogues was studied. RESULTS: Extrusion types and addition of wheat gluten had a major influence on physicochemical characteristics which were critical in controlling the fibrous texture of the final product, while screw speed had a minor impact on springiness only (P < 0.001). All high-moisture meat analogues (HMMAs) were associated with a higher integrity index and greater stability of springiness and cutting strength than low-moisture meat analogues (LMMAs) using the same formula and screw speed, while the nitrogen solubility index of HMMAs was lower. Based on the physicochemical properties determined, the higher cross-link formation in HMMAs is proposed to occur in the cooling die section.

        "abstract": "Well-defined shear flow can be applied to create fibrous, anisotropic samples from biopolymers when present at sufficiently high dry matter contents. Anisotropic biopolymer structures are of high interest especially when made from plant-based polymer blends due to novel food applications, like meat replacers. We investigate shear-induced structuring of a pectin/soy protein isolate (SPI) blend under heating. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis revealed that shear-induced structuring resulted in elongated pectin filaments, oriented in the direction of the shear flow, being entrapped in a continuous protein phase, inducing anisotropy in the blend. The length of the pectin filaments increased upon higher pectin concentrations and shearing temperatures, leading both to higher anisotropy, as measured with the tensile strength analysis. The fibrous appearance of samples became more evident when deforming the product by tearing, which effect was thought to be caused by detachment through or along the long side of the pectin filament. Industrial relevance: The efficient preparation of fibrous products based on plant materials is of interest, because these products can be a starting point for the development of meat replacers. Meat replacers made from plant material are a promising, innovative, and sustainable source of protein for human consumption. With an increasing world population, creation of innovative sources of protein are needed to be able to feed everyone (United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015). Proteins from plant sources, such as soy, are preferred over proteins from animal origin because plant based materials, for example, have lower environmental impact (Day, 2013; Mogensen, Hermansen, Halberg, Dalgaard, R., Vis, & Smith, 2009). In order to replace meat by a plant-based meat replacer, it is important that a similar product in terms of structural properties is developed to improve consumer acceptance (Hoek et al., 2011). Meat replacers are often produced with extrusion cooking, which is a process that has been applied for texturization of plant materials in the application of meat replacers for decades (Campbell, 1981; Harper & Clark, 1978). Previous research showed that a novel technique based on well-defined shear flow can also be used to create fibrous, anisotropic structures from plant-based biopolymers at sufficiently high dry matter contents, with a cone–cone device (Shear Cell) or a concentric cylinder device (Couette Cell) (Grabowska, Tekidou, Boom, & van der Goot, 2014; G. A. Krintiras, Göbel, Bouwman, van der Goot, & Stefanidis, 2014; Manski, van der Goot, & Boom, 2007). This novel technique uses milder conditions for structure formation, due to lower applied shear forces, and has therefore a lower specific mechanical energy input",

First, we determine the relaxation rate of absorbed water, and the viscoelastic properties of the separated phases as function of the water content. Next, the same properties are measured for the protein blends. Finally, predictions for water distribution obtained from rheological experiments are made via the polymer blending law, and compared to a more direct assessment of the water distribution with time-domain NMR relaxometry (TD-NMR). In this study, the protein blend consists of soy protein isolate (SPI) and vital wheat gluten (WG). We demonstrate that predictions for water distribution are similar for both TD-NMR and rheological measurements. It turns out that water does not distribute homogenously over the phases. Independent of the SPI and WG ratio, more water is absorbed by the SPI phase relative to the WG phase, which largely determines the resulting rheological properties of the blends.",

        "abstract": "Soy protein, mixed with gluten and starch, was extruded into fibrous meat analogues under highmoisture and high-temperature conditions. The protein solubility of samples collected at different extruder zones and extrudates made with different moistures was determined by 11 extraction solutions consisting of 6 selective reagents and their combinations: phosphate salts, urea, DTT, thiourea, Triton X-100, and CHAPS. Protein solubility by most extractants showed decreasing patterns as the material passed through the extruder, but the solution containing all 6 reagents, known as isoelectric focus (IEF) buffer, solubilized the highest levels and equal amounts of proteins in all samples, indicating that there are no other covalent bonds involved besides disulfide bonds. With regard to relative importance between disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions, different conclusions could be made from protein solubility patterns, depending on the type of extracting systems and a baseline used for comparison. The observation points out pitfalls and limitation of current protein solubility methodology and explains why controversy exists in the literature. Using the IEF buffer system with omission of one or more selective reagents is considered to be the right methodology to conduct protein solubility study and thus recommended. Results obtained with this system indicate that disulfide bonding plays a more important role than non-covalent bonds in not only holding the rigid structure of extrudates but also forming fibrous texture. The sharpest decrease in protein solubility occurred when the mix passed through the intermediate section of the extruder barrel, indicating formation of new disulfide bonds during the stage of dramatic increase in both temperature and moisture. After this stage, although the physical form of the product might undergo change and fiber formation might occur as it passed through the cooling die, the chemical nature of the product did not change significantly.",

Such levels reduce or prevent viscous dissipation of energy and product expansion, but facilitate operations such as fat emulsification, sterilization, protein gelation, restructuring and shaping of comminuted meat or fish, and microcoagulation and/or fibrillation of specific protein constituents. Fibrous gelled structures are obtained from (a) defatted soy flours or concentrates; (b) wheat gluten; and (c) mixes containing 70–80% surimi plus 30–20% soy concentrate or gluten, by extrusion cooking at 50–70% moisture, at barrel temperatures above 140°C, using long cooling dies. The continuous gelled bands are highly resistant to stretching in the longitudinal direction. They display a multilayer and partly fibrous structure. An extruded crab analog with a finely fibrous texture, made from Alaska pollack surimi plus egg white and 1% starch, is already commercialized in Japan. Three main phenomena are involved in the formation of these structures: (a) protein plastification (“melting”) within the extruder, which requires a barrel temperature of 140–180°C (at 60–70% water), a residence time close to 150 s, and high shear forces; (b) stability of extrusion conditions, without surging (often difficult to achieve); (c) presence of a long cooling die, exerting essential functions: upstream pressure generation, enabling high temperature, channel filling, and extrudate continuity; progressive reduction of the mechanical and thermal energy of the food mix, permitting proper shaping, while avoiding product expansion; alignment of dispersed protein particules along the shear gradient in the narrow die channel, leading to layer and fiber formation. The restructuring of mechanically deboned meat can be achieved through extrusion cooking (40–50% water) in the presence of high levels of binders such as starch or cereal flours. Such experiments were carried out without a cooling die and without fiber formation. Emulsified and gelled cheese analogs, with textures ranging from hard blocks to soft spreads, can be obtained with a single extruder pass, starting from cheddar or from caseinate plus various fats. The extents of fat emulsification and of casein “reassociation,” and the melting ability, depend on composition and process parameters. The extrusion of fibrous products similar to mozzarella‐based string cheese is attempted. Fat substitutes with a smooth and spread‐like consistency are also prepared by thermomechanical processing of caseinate and/or whey proteins in a twin‐screw extruder at an acid or neutral pH. Shear forces and several biochemical mechanisms concur to induce the “microcoagulation” of β‐lactoglobulin as small‐size particles (<20 μm). Other potential moist extrusion processes include the coagulation of skim milk powder into an insoluble acid casein coprecipitate, the encapsulation of small molecules into protein gels, and the formation of edible thin protein films.",

        "title": "Extrusion of Food Proteins",
        "abstract": "Protein extrusion has frustrated earlier predictions regarding its impact in the development of food products. The main reason for this disappointing performance has been its failure to yield fabricated food products with textural quality close enough to that of natural products at competitive prices. Texturized soya protein by extrusion is presently the only commercial success in this area, being incorporated into several convenience products, increasing their protein content and quality and conferring them some desirable sensory properties. Technological and scientific gaps in the extrusion texturization are still to be bridged if this technique is to be applied for upgrading unconventional protein. The precise mechanisms responsible for protein texturization through extrusion are still unclear. Proteins show a very wide range of extrusion behavior that is probably related to large differences in their association properties. New peptide bonds, formed by free amino and carboxylic groups of the protein, were postulated as being responsible for the cross-linking that takes place in protein extrusion. However, disulfide bonds and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are regarded presently as the texturization mechanism in this process. The recently suggested suspension (or filled \"melt\") model for biopolymer extrusion offered a new framework for testing extrusion of novel proteins. According to this view, the large differences between the association properties of proteins produce different types of aggregates. Some of them can be insoluble under extrusion conditions and act as a dispersed phase within the melt phase. The extrusion performance of a protein will thus depend on the amount of insoluble aggregate produced inside the extruder and on protein-protein interactions that occur after the superheated molten mass leaves it.",

During the extrusion process of TVP, under the comprehensive effects of temperature, shear force, and pressure, complex conformational changes and molecular interactions amongst protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and other components occur, all of which influence the quality of TVP. Control of the extrusion process is still one of the largest challenges in its evolution. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the development and current status of food extrusion technology for TVP production and give detailed descriptions about the conformational changes of the main components during the extrusion process, focusing on the effects of barrel temperature, moisture content, feed rate and screw speed on TVP quality. Lastly, we discuss approaches to characterize the extrusion process and propose a new system analysis model.",

Extrudate texture was found to depend mainly on feed moisture, screw speed and barrel temperature, in this decreasing order.

        "abstract": "Meat is considered as a complete protein source as it contains all 9 of the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized de novo by human beings and are thus must come from the diet alone. Furthermore, the functional attributes of proteins in meat such as gelation, emulsification and water holding capacity are unmatched to any other protein source (Xiong, 2005). In developing countries, consumption of meat per capita has rapidly increased in recent years, primarily due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, increasing population size and rise in income (Kumar et al., 2017). However, there are many issues associated with meat production in its present form and these are leading the search for suitable and sustainable alternatives. Rearing of animals for meat production involves converting vegetable protein into animal protein, which is highly intensive process. Production of vegetable crops requires comparatively less water, land and energy per unit as compared to per unit production of meat and thus the transition of proteins can be considered inefficient (Steinfeld et al., 2006; Bruinsma, 2009). Meat production is often associated with environmental strain due to emission of greenhouse gases and water pollution (streams and rivers) as well as rampant deforestation for the expansion of livestock farms that has all put additional pressure on natural resources (Steinfeld et al., 2006; Aiking, 2011). From a dietary point of view, the consumption of meat delivers essential nutrients and energy but a direct relationship with the overconsumption of meat and the incidence of certain diseases has been established (Mehta et al., 2015). Larsson and Wolk (2006) suggested that the consumption of 120 g red meat/day or 30 g processed meat/day would significantly raise the risk of colorectal cancer in human beings. Certain people avoid the overconsumption (or consumption altogether) of specific types of meat due to high saturated fat and cholesterol content as well as various unrelated reasons such as religious views or animal welfare concerns. All these concerns have combined together to spur the debate on the sustainability of meat as a diet for humans. For years, the fabrication of protein rich foods using plant sources has been a research interest amongst food scientists; the major challenge being the simulation of texture, taste, colour, flavor and nutritive value equitable to meat. Commonly known as meat analogs, meat substitutes, meat alternatives or faux meat, these products have had a surge in popularity in recent years, though presently still only account for a marginal share of the total meat market (",

Two separate latent class analyses reveal seven consumer types with five in each country. A large cluster from both countries will not consider substituting meat with legumes or buying processed legume products. Another cluster will consider processed legume products if the products are not marketed as an alternative to meat. Although they do not use them regularly, many consumers in NZ are open to using meat substitutes made from legumes.

Our in vitro experiments show that C2N is toxic to human umbilical vein/vascular endothelium cells. The further combined experimental and theoretical studies unravel that the cytotoxicity of C2N mainly originates from its oxidative capability toward the antioxidant molecules, leading to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species in cells. Compared with graphene oxide, C2N exerts a relatively milder cytotoxicity, and importantly, this novel material shows negligible physical destruction effects on cell membranes, suggesting that C2N might be a potential alternative to graphene and its derivatives in biomedical research.

Meat analogues are products that replace meat in its functionality, i.e. have similar product properties and sensory attributes, which is achieved by the fibrous nature of those products.\n\nScope and approach\nThe techniques used to make fibrous products that mimic muscle meats are outlined and categorized based on their approach. The bottom-up approach refers to assembly of structural elements that are combined. The top-down approach refers to structuring of biopolymer blends using an overall force field. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are discussed in terms of ingredient and equipment use, (achievable) product resemblance, robustness, scalability, and resource efficiency. To enlarge the theoretical framework, the techniques with the top-down strategy are further contextualized by relating to structure formation processes of materials with other applications, and the methods to analyse the fibrous structures are further outlined.\n\nKey findings and conclusions\nTechniques that follow the bottom-up strategy have the potential to resemble the structure of meat most closely, by structuring the proteins hierarchically through assembly of individual structural components. The top-down strategy is better scalable, is more efficient in its use of resources, but can only create the desired structure on larger length scales. Significant progress has been made on the methods to analyse structured products from the last category.

Covalent disulfide and sulfhydryl bonding as well as electrostatic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic affinity developing among molecules during extrusion determine extrudate sensory quality, digestibility, and nutrient availability. Extrudate quality is dependent on the physical profile of the feed material from particle size to moisture concentration, the mechanical profile of the twin-screw extruder from screw speed to die aperture, and the temperature, pressure, and shear leading to specific mechanical energy delivered in the extruder. Methods to assess extrudate physical and sensory quality are presented. Protein concentration, feed moisture, and extrusion temperatures are most important to expansion, density, and texture of extrudates. Fortification with whey and wheat proteins results in acceptable extrusion of snack and breakfast foods. Extrusion generally improves protein quality and digestibility while retaining active nutrients.",

Extrusion cooking technology has led to production of wide variety of products like pasta, breakfast cereals, bread crumbs, biscuits, crackers, croutons, baby foods, snack foods, confectionery items, chewing gum, texturized vegetable protein (TVP), modified starch, pet foods, dried soups, dry beverage mixes etc. The functional properties of extruded foods plays an important role for their acceptability which include water absorption, water solubility, oil absorption indexes, expansion index, bulk density and viscosity of the dough. The aim of this review is to give the detailed outlines about the potential of extrusion technology in development of different types of products and the role of extrusion operating conditions and their effect on product development resulting in quality changes i.e physical, chemical and nutritional, experienced during the extrusion process.",

        "abstract": "Background\nPlant-based meat alternatives are developed to address consumer demands and sustainability of future food supply, and the market has grown exponentially in recent years. Although progresses have been made to construct plant protein-based fibers organoleptically comparable to a whole-muscle cut, it remains challenging to reproduce the hierarchical organization of muscle tissue known to contribute to the overall sensory profile. For now, the market strategies are largely focused on restructured or formed meat mimeticks.\n\nScope and approaches\nLiterature search and supermarket surveys are conducted to identify processing technologies, product formulations, and the chemistry and functionality of various additives applied in meat alternatives production. Comparisons are made between muscle and legume proteins to elucidate disparities in macroscopic aggregation properties that may be greatly diminished through fabrication and ingredient innovation. Due to the highly formulated and processed nature, the nutrition, health, and safety of plant-based meat alternatives are analyzed.\n\nKey findings and conclusion\nThermoextrusion is found to be the principal reconstructuring technique for meat-like fiber synthesis from plant proteins. Soy and pea proteins, gluten, and polysaccharides are the major building blocks. Through physicochemical interactions, plant proteins are able to aggregate into particles and anisotropic fibrils to impart meat-like texture and mouthfeel. Vegetable oil blends and spices are used to modify the texture and flavor; pigments are added to impart color; vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and antimicrobials are incorporated to boost nutrition and improve shelf-life. Opportunities exist to overcome technology obstacles and nutrition and safety challenges in further developing the alternatives market.",

S49%MC had the highest hardness and chewiness, observed with chunks of long fibres under SEM. The hardness and chewiness of sausages decreased as MC increased. S60%MC exhibited soft and mushy texture, and no fibre structure was observed. Sausages made from meat alternatives had higher protein oxidation as compared with reference sausage made from chicken breast (SCB), which could be due to longer storage period, as meat alternatives were extruded, frozen and stored before making into sausages.

        "abstract": "Our global community is facing the challenge of providing sufficient food for Earth’s growing population, without compromising the ecosystem. The nutritional transition that occurred in the 20th century made livestock the primary source of protein globally (Delgado et al., 2001; Grigg, 1995). However, with the animal welfare and the planet issues (Aiking, 2014; de Boer et al., 2017; Friel et al., 2009; Westhoek et al., 2014), experts argue that serious consequences for global food security are emerging and therefore stress the importance of a transition to lowering meat consumption (Aiking, 2011; Boland et al., 2013; Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, 2016). The production and consumption of animal proteins in the form of meat or dairy products is an intensive practice for the environment (Bruinsma, 2009; Koneswaran and Nierenberg, 2008). Large amounts of arable land, water and raw materials are required, while the conversion of grains and other crops into animal proteins is highly energy-consuming (Cassidy et al., 2013; de Boer et al., 2017; Wilkinson, 2011). Moreover, doubling the production of meat and dairy to meet the predicted protein demand in 2050 is most alarming, considering that the environmental impact of livestock must be reduced in half only to prevent the current level of ecological damage from being exceeded (de Bakker and Dagevos, 2012). Therefore, the research community is targeting on refining the current production systems, searching for efficient novel technologies, while at the same time focusing on the improvement of consumption habits and food cultures. In this chapter, the currently available plant-based meat analogues and their ingredients are presented, while the principles of the structuring techniques, the environmental benefits and their market prospect are discussed, too",

Further, interrelationships between system response parameters and quality of the extrudate were analyzed. Results showed that for controlling the die pressure and die temperature, the shear way plays a decisive role, followed by the extrusion temperature, and finally the moisture content. SME is mainly determined by the moisture content and the energy input intensity. Shear way can significantly improve the fibrous structure. Extrusion temperature is the decisive factor in the tensile properties and springiness. While the moisture content plays a more important role in the color values and the hardness.

The effect of extrusion parameters on extruder responses [die pressure, product temperature, torque and specific mechanical energy (SME)] and product properties [colour, cutting force, cooking yield, microstructure and in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD)] was evaluated.\n\nResults: The multiple regression analysis of the results revealed that the water feed had a significant negative linear effect on the extruder responses considered, as well as on colour difference and cutting force of extrudates. Screw speed had a positive linear effect on product temperature, SME and cooking yield. Barrel temperature affected extruder responses and product properties to a lesser extent. Scanning electron microscopy showed that denser microstructure and higher number of fibre layers were created by increasing temperature and screw speed along with decreasing water feed. The results of IVPD of selected extrudates showed that the increase in barrel temperature decreased the IVPD, whereas the increase in water feed resulted in higher IVPD. The screw speed had no significant effect on IVPD.\n\nConclusion: The study demonstrates that the use of lupin protein is feasible to produce meat analogues with HME which could enhance the possibilities to meet the growing protein demands for human consumption.",

Layered or fibrous microstructure of meat analogues was observed using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. Meat analogues containing 20%WG and 30%WG were found to exhibit fibrous microstructure with large fibrous structures interconnected with much smaller fibres. The types of chemical bonding in meat analogues were tested with urea (U), dithiothreitol (DTT) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS); findings suggested that a large portion of aggregated proteins were linked with hydrogen bonds. Disulphide bonds became increasingly important as the amount of WG was increased, and synergies between hydrogen bonds and disulphide bonds were evident from increased solubility effects with mixed solvents, especially U and DTT.

It was shown that ninhydrin, a reagent capable of irreversibly binding with free amino groups, significantly inhibited texture formation. When texturization was studied as a function of pH adjustment (- 4-10), maximum Warner-Bratzler shear values and sensory response were found to occur close to pH 8, where amino groups are unprotonated and more reactive. At the extremes of the pH range extrudates lost structural integrity, were more soluble, and an examination of their microstructure showed that the interconnected longitudinal vacuoles separated by thick cell walls normally seen were replaced by a denser globoid system. Soy protein isolate was acylated using either acetic or succinic anhydride. Both treatments resulted in a significant decrease in extrudate texture but increases in extrudate solubility; the latter finding tends to discount the importance of solubility in texture formation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the acylated extrudates exhibited less cellularity and were denser than the control materials. The soluble fraction of acylated proteins demonstrated increased electrophoretic mobility as a result of the loss of the cationic amino groups.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally (World Health Organisation, 2011). Many of the risk factors for CVD are modifiable, including overweight and obesity. Numerous strategies have been proposed to fight CVD, with a special focus being placed on dietary interventions for weight management. The literature suggests that two nutrients, fiber and protein, may play significant roles in weight control and hence cardiovascular health. Increasing both protein and fiber in the diet can be difficult because popular low-carbohydrate and high-protein diets tend to have considerably low-fiber intakes (Slavin, 2005). One approach to obtain both is to develop functional foods using unique ingredients. Lupin flour is a novel food ingredient derived from the endosperm of lupin. It contains 40–45% protein, 25–30% fiber, and negligible sugar and starch (Petterson and Crosbie, 1990). Research conducted to date reveals that lupin-enriched foods, which are naturally high in protein and fiber, may have a significant effect on CVD risk factors.

The physicochemical properties including solubility, surface charge/hydrophobicity, and interfacial properties have been examined to evaluate their emulsifying functionality.

This is an inconvenience for people allergic to soy, and therefore it is necessary to look for alternatives to this protein to improve their quality of life. In this study, changes in the physicochemical and nutritional properties of cooked turkey breast containing various sources of alternative proteins to soy proteins (pea, broad bean, lentil, Spirulina and Chlorella) were evaluated. Samples formulated with algae showed significant (p < 0.05) changes on physical parameters and chemical composition of cooked turkey breast. Color parameters were also affected by protein source, showing the highest L* values in samples prepared with Chlorella and Spirulina protein (56.13). On the other hand, a* values were lower in cooked turkey breasts containing algal proteins (−2.34 Chlorella and −1.08 Spirulina) compared to control (1.66). Regarding textural parameters, the cooked turkey breast samples prepared with Chlorella protein showed the lowest hardness values (16.89 N) compared to those elaborated with soy protein (36.95 N). The replacement of soy protein by the other algae and vegetable protein sources did not change the adhesiveness values, ranging between 0.56 and 0.75 N·s, for samples manufactured with Chlorella and soy protein, respectively. Amino acids profile was improved when complemented with Spirulina protein, presenting the highest levels of essential amino acids (6.20 g/100 g). In addition, the ratio between essential and non‐essential amino acids increased (from 0.96 to 1.03 for broad bean and Chlorella, respectively). Hence, this study demonstrates that the inclusion of algae proteins can be considered as an alternative to soy proteins for cooked turkey breast formulations and can be a novel source of proteins for people allergic to soy proteins.

        "abstract": "The effects of substituting 1.5% of the meat proteins with low gelling soy protein isolate (LGS), high gelling soy protein isolate (HGS), native whey protein isolate (NWP), and preheated whey protein isolate (PWP) were compared at varying levels of proteins (12, 13 and 14%), with all meat control batters prepared with canola oil. Cooking losses were lower for all the non-meat protein treatments compared to the all meat controls. When raising the protein level from 12 to 14%, cooking losses increased in all treatments except for the NWP treatments. Using LGS increased emulsification and resulted in a more stable meat batters at the 13 and 14% protein treatments. Textural profile analysis results showed that elevating protein level increased hardness and cohesiveness. The highest hardness values were obtained for the PWP treatments and the lowest for the HGS, indicating a strong non-meat protein effect on texture modification. Non-meat protein addition resulted in lighter and less red products (i.e., lower red meat content) compared to the all meat controls; color affected by non-meat protein type. Light microscopy revealed that non-meat proteins decreased the frequency of fat globules' agglomeration and protein aggregation. The whey protein preparations and HGS formed distinct “islands” within the meat batters' matrices, which appeared to interact with the meat protein matrix",

        "title": "Nonmeat Protein Alternatives as Meat Extenders and Meat Analogs",
        "abstract": "The direct consumption of vegetable proteins in food products has been increasing over the years because of animal diseases, global shortage of animal protein, strong demand for wholesome and religious (halal) food, and economic reasons. The increasing importance of legume and oilseed proteins in the manufacturing of various functional food products is due to their high-protein contents. However, the greatest obstacle to utilizing these legumes and oilseeds is the presence of antinutrients; but these antinutrients can be successfully removed or inactivated by employing certain processing methods. In contrast, the potential negative impact of the antinutrients is partially balanced by the fact that they may have a health-promoting role. Legumes and oilseeds provide well-balanced amino acid profiles when consumed with cereals. Soybean proteins, wheat gluten, cottonseed proteins, and other plant proteins have been used for texturization. Texturized vegetable proteins can extend meat products while providing an economical, functional, and high-protein food ingredient or can be consumed directly as a meat analog. Meat analogs are successful because of their healthy image (cholesterol free), meat-like texture, and low cost. Mycoprotein is fungal in origin and is used as a high-protein, low-fat, health-promoting food ingredient. Mycoprotein has a good taste and texture. Texturized vegetable proteins and a number of mycoprotein products are accepted as halal foods. This article summarizes information regarding the molecular, nutritional, and functional properties of alternative protein sources to meat and presents current knowledge to encourage further research to optimize the beneficial effects of alternative protein sources.",

The physical, functional, and sensory properties of soybean were sensitive to moist heat treatment, and such treatments can have a substantial influence on their use in food systems. Goat meat patties were selected to evaluate the potential application of FFSP in meat food system. The soy proteins incorporated in goat meat patties as FFSP increased moisture and fat and decreased protein, shrinkage, hardness, springiness, chewiness, and shear force values. Sensory analysis of patties showed that use of FFSP resulted in a reduction of specific soybean off-flavor (beany and bitter notes) and off-aroma. Addition of paste made the goat meat patties more tender and juicy, and overall acceptability of the products was comparable to control. Soy proteins as FFSP could be utilized as nonmeat protein source and could improve the sensory characteristics of comminuted meat products to which they are added.",

Results indicated the vitamin C and phenolic metabolites such as condensed tannin can be increased at certain stages such as at 12 h over the 48 h fermentation period. Whereas antioxidant activity based on DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity generally decreased from initial unfermented stage range of (75%–95%) to consistently in the 50% range by 48 h of fermentation and this follows the decrease in viable counts. The fermentation process increased the condensed tannin contents in CAJ whereas hydrolysable tannins decreased. In this study the changes in flavor volatile types were also analyzed over the course of CAJ fermentation. The results indicated that LAB changed the flavor profiles of fermented CAJ and overall the fruity odor decreased, but the whiskey and acid odor increased.

        "abstract": "This work studies the interactions, thermodynamics, phase behaviour, and rheology of mucin/gelatin binary mixtures. Addition of gelatin in mucin solutions at pH 7 leads to aggregation and phase separation, while such phenomena are not observed at lower pH values. Zeta potential measurements show that electrostatic interactions lead to the formation of soluble complexes between the mucin and gelatin at pH 3. However, steric exclusions are the prime candidates for inducing any interactions between the two macromolecular populations at pH 7. Fluorimetry shows two binding regimes for mucin/gelatin mixtures at pH 3, and one at pH 7. ΔG show higher negative value at pH 7, as compared to pH 3; this can account for the tendency of gelatin to flocculate in the presence of mucin at neutral environments but not in acidic ones. The Trouton ratio (ratio of extensional to shear viscosity) is low at pH 3, but unusually high at pH 7 due to the aggregated structures. The above highlight the molecular events leading to the flow of gelatin-based foods during oral processing.",

Rice starch added with GG at concentrations of 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, or 0.10 g/100 g (wet basis) was subject to a micro-extrusion process. The in vitro digestibility, predicted glycemic index (pGI), and multi-scale structures (granule, lamellar, crystalline, and molecular structures) were examined. Micro-extruded rice starch (MERS) with GG presented reduced digestion rate and pGI, a higher degree of structural ordering, and altered crystalline, single-helical and double-helical structures. Using Pearson correlation analysis, the relationships among extrusion, the molecular interaction and multi-scale structure, and the digestibility were established. The content of resistant components (RC) was positively correlated with crystallinity (r = 0.836, p < 0.05), fractal dimension (r = 0.966, p < 0.05), A-type crystallinity (r = 0.954, p < 0.01), V-type crystallinity (r = 0.987, p < 0.05), R1045/1022 (r = 0.987, p < 0.05), single-helix content (r = 0.897, p < 0.05), and double-helix content (r = 0.991, p < 0.01); and was negatively correlated with pGI (r = −0.947, p < 0.05).

The binding constant (Ka) and the associated thermodynamic parameters determined showed weak noncovalent interactions, particularly due to electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effect. The degree and the type of esterification of each pectic fractions had a significant effect on the binding constants determined by ITC and NMR experiments. The binding constants ranged from 102 to 104 M−1, with the highest Ka value observed for the interaction between cy3glc and low methylesterified fraction, followed by the amidated fraction. Pectic fractions with a higher degree of methyl esterification, resulted on lower binding affinities, with these interactions being mostly driven by hydrophobic effect compared to enthalpy. The different binding affinities could be correlated with anthocyanins colour impact, as a higher red colour intensity could be observed for a cy3glc model solution fortified with a low methylated fraction. However, this colour improvement was not observed for amidated fraction, presumably due to charge repulsive forces, lowering the stability of the flavylium cation.",

The dimensions (wall thickness, height, and diameter), weight as well as physical properties (melting properties, flow behaviour, snap ability) of the 3D printed chocolate were evaluated. The nozzle temperature before deposition was maintained at 32 °C in order to extrude the melted state of the sample as the flow behaviour curves indicated that the melting of chocolate started between 28 °C to 30 °C. Incorporation of Magnesium Stearate (MgST) in the chocolate formulation aid in material lubrication and increase flow efficiency during deposition. Results showed that there was a minor difference between the predetermined diameter and the actual output diameter for each sample suggesting similarity between the printed 3D structure and the pre-designed 3D model. Wall thickness of printed item varied along the height due to uneven deposition of chocolate as the layer height increased.

Whole grain flours of two hulled barley varieties, Lyon and Muir, and three hull‐less barley varieties, Havener, 09WA‐265.12, and Meg's Song, were extruded with a co‐rotating twin‐screw extruder. The impacts of feed moisture, screw speed, and die temperature on functional properties of extrudates were investigated. Findings: Expansion ratio (ER) of barleys was slightly lower compared to the reported numbers for cereals such as corn. Hulled varieties showed significantly higher ER compared to the hull‐less varieties. Havener was the only hull‐less variety having comparable ER with hulled varieties and moderate levels of ß‐glucan. ER correlated positively with water solubility index (r = 0.680, p < 0.01), specific mechanical energy (r = 0.633, p < 0.01), and negatively with unit density (r = −0.729, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Hulled varieties are better suited for extrusion expansion. Feed moisture and die temperature had a strong influence on expansion, while screw speed showed marginal effects.

While there is no doubt that one's ability of texture discrimination depends on various oral physiological characteristics of the individual, it is not yet clear how tongue surface temperature affects the sensitivity of texture discrimination. This study was designed to test the effects of tongue surface temperature on oral tactile sensitivity and viscosity discrimination. A total of twenty healthy subjects (ten females and ten males; mean age: 25 ± 1 yrs, mean body mass index: 20.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2) participated in this study. Water at different temperatures (0, 20, 37, and 45 °C) and capsaicin solutions (5,10, and 20 ppm) were used as physical and chemical stimulations to alter tongue temperature, respectively. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, Bio-Thesiometer, and Touch-Test®Two-point discriminator were respectively applied to assess the tongue's sensitivity of light touch, vibratory perception and two-point discrimination before and after treatment with both physical and chemical stimuli. Maltodextrin solutions were used for oral viscosity discrimination. Tongue's vibratory perception thresholds varied significantly (P < 0.01), indicating an increase of 0.6 × 10−6cm in vibratory perception threshold when tongue surface temperature decreased from 33 °C to 20 °C, while light touch and two-point discrimination thresholds remained unchanged. The application of capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 ppm) produced an increase in tongue surface temperature but did not affect oral tactile sensitivity. Viscosity discrimination increased both after rinsing the mouth with warm water and capsaicin application (20 ppm). Capsaicin (20 ppm) increased tongue temperature by 1.3 °C and lead to a decrease in viscosity discrimination threshold from 34.7% to 20.2%. After stimulation with water at 37 °C and 45 °C, the tongue temperature increased by 3 °C (from 34.2 °C to 37.2 °C), while threshold of viscosity discrimination decreased from 28.1% to 23.1%. When water was used to change tongue surface temperature, a positive correlation was found between vibratory perception sensitivity and viscosity discrimination ability, suggesting the capacity of discriminating viscosity might depend on vibratory perception sensitivity.",

First, we explored the change in foam volume with time. Results showed that foam stability (FS) increased with the increasing of bulk concentration of TA. The number of actual aggregates in foam lamella which accounts for improved foam stability was well quantified using optical microscopy and CLSM. Besides, the surface dilatational rheological properties indicated that the formation of the SC/TA complex increased the elastic modulus (Ed) of the air/water interface, which is useful for inhibiting collapse. Finally, adsorbed proteins were obtained by freeze-drying method and proteins were labeled and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-ESI–MS/MS) for protein identification and quantification. The results showed that the significant improvement in the foam stability of the system is due to the addition of TA to increase the amount of κ-casein adsorbed on the interface, resulting in a more elastic air/water interface. The results presented in this study should provide detailed quantitative information of the interfacial layer, and will facilitate the application of the formed protein/polyphenol complex as functional ingredients in food and non-food systems.",

Ultrasonic power had a significant effect on the properties of emulsion, which are important to the properties of the particles. Moreover, the morphology of solidification product is related to the applied voltage connected to the spinneret and collector. The highest encapsulation efficiency, up to 39 ± 4%, was exhibited in the electrosprayed particles obtained from the emulsions prepared using a power of 360 W. β-Carotene and encapsulates incorporated bar retained their sensory characteristics and almost similar to control.

        "abstract": "Pomegranate seed oil is rich of conjugated fatty acids which are highly appealing for a variety of applications in food industry. In this research, ovalbumin (OVA) and ovalbumin-inulin glycoconjugates with different Maillard reaction times were used to stabilize pomegranate seed oil emulsions and their impact on physicochemical stability and oxidative stability of the products was investigated. The OVA-inulin glycoconjugate produced on 10th day of Maillard reaction has exhibited significantly higher conjugation efficiency, lower surface hydrophobicity and lower surface tension than other glycoconjugates. The secondary conformation of OVA and conjugates determined by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy has remarkably changed. The reduction in intensity of Trp-fluorescence observed in glycated proteins with inulin indicated that the glycation affected partially the side chains of protein in tertiary structure through the Maillard reaction without great disruption of native structure. The emulsion stabilized by OVA-inulin glycoconjugate obtained by 10 days Maillard reaction has shown the best physicochemical stability. Compared with the OVA emulsion, the oxidative stability of the glycated OVA emulsion system was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Fatty acid profile results also confirmed that OVA-inulin glycoconjugates were able to prevent the pomegranate seed oil from oxidation. It is suggested that the inulin attached to OVA by glycation played a vital role in physicochemical stability and oxidative stability of pomegranate seed oil emulsions.",

        "abstract": "Food-grade aerogels were fabricated from camelina seed mucilage for the first time using a green approach based on supercritical carbon dioxide (SC–CO2). A high mucilage yield (11%, w/w) was obtained from camelina seed by water extraction. Drying of the extracted mucilage solution prior to the aerogel formation was eliminated by coupling the extraction of the mucilage with the hydrogel formation. The camelina mucilage aerogels exhibited high surface area (240 m2 /g), nanoporous structure (6 nm), ultra-low density (0.05 g/cm3 ) and high porosity (94%). The camelina mucilage aerogels had a three-dimensional, open porous, fibrillar network structure. The crystallinity of the aerogels was lower than that of the crude mucilage powder, whereas the aerogels showed higher thermal stability. A non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior was observed in all the mucilage samples. However, mucilage aerogels had a higher viscosity than the mucilage powder due to higher polysaccharide purity. Mucilage aerogels showed comparable rheological properties to xanthan gum at the same concentration (2%, w/w). Thus, the mucilage aerogels are great candidates to be used as thickeners and stabilizers in various food applications.",

        "abstract": "The suppression mechanism of L-arginine (Arg) in fish myosin heat-induced aggregation was investigated in this work. The hydrodynamic radius determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the turbidity of a myosin solution decreased in a dose-dependently manner with Arg after heating, especially in a solution without pH modification (P < 0.05). The surface hydrophobicity of myosin exhibited the same trend as that for hydrodynamic radius and turbidity (P < 0.05). The myosin secondary structures clearly changed with Arg concentration during heating (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that positively-charged Arg could form ionic interactions with negatively charged myosin, as well as promote repulsion between myosin molecules induced by higher pH values. Furthermore, the resultant hydrogen bonding observed indicated that, in addition to Arg having ionic linkage effects, the specific structure of Arg played an important role in the suppression of myosin aggregation. Essentially, Arg markedly disturbed the hydrogen bonds of the myosin backbone and formed new hydrogen bonds with myosin molecules via two amino groups (-NH2), which are part of the guanidinium moiety of Arg, preferentially hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of myosin molecules. This work provides support for using Arg as an additive to modify the texture of fish products to produce liquid and semiliquid food suitable for the elderly consumers in an aging society.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigated the properties of egg white protein hydrolysate (EH) prepared from alkali-induced egg white gel as an oil-in-water emulsion stabilizer. The physicochemical properties of EH, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), surface hydrophobicity, particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index were investigated. Meanwhile, the microstructure, emulsion stability, oil oxidative stability, in vitro digestive stability and antioxidant activity of emulsion prepared by EH were evaluated. Results suggested that the surface hydrophobicity of EH decreased due to the destruction of hydrophobic groups, and the particle size of most hydrolysates ranged from 124.24 to 197.7 nm, except neutrase and alcalase hydrolysates. FTIR revealed that the strength of each peak increased significantly after hydrolysis owing to the break of structure and peptide bond. Most EH-stabilized emulsions were stable against droplets aggregation as influenced by temperature, and emulsion prepared from trypsin hydrolysate exhibited better ionic strength and storage stability. Emulsion stabilized by trypsin and alcalase hydrolysates delayed the lipids oxidation during storage. Droplet aggregation occurred to emulsions after in vitro digestion due to the destruction of the emulsion structure and the accumulation of proteins and lipids, and the release rate of free fatty acids ranged from 55.72% to 77.29% in the 2 h vitro intestine digestion for six different emulsions. Additionally, most digested EH-stabilized emulsion enhanced its ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS and O2 free radical, owing to the formation of antioxidant peptides. These results suggest that EH can be as a potential stabilizer for emulsions, especially trypsin hydrolysate, and possesses antioxidant properties after digestion.",

Samples are pretreated through liquideliquid extraction and solidphase extraction. This method is time consuming and requires the intensive use of solvents. To improve analytical efficiency and reduce costs, our study incorporated QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) techniques to establish a new method of multiresidue analysis of b-agonists in animal muscle and viscera. The pretreatment time was shortened and solvent usage was minimized. The modified analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LCeMS/MS) and quantification was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients of the tissue calibration curve were higher than 0.99 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1 ppb. The average recoveries in spiked samples varied from 70% to 120%, and the relative difference between duplicated analysis results was lower than 10%. On the basis of the results, the proposed method was concluded to be an appropriate procedure for determining the presence of b-agonists, and demonstrated the advantages of high recovery rates in spiked samples, high precision, reduced analysis time and solvent usage, and lower costs",

In this study, initial sugar and nitrogen (urea) concentrations in sweet sorghum stem juice (SSJ) were optimized for high PE (≥ 10%, v/v), QP, (≥ 2.5 g/L·h) and SC (≥ 90%) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae SSJKKU01. Then, repeated-batch fermentations under normal gravity (NG) and high gravity (HG) conditions were studied.\n\nResults\nThe initial sugar at 208 g/L and urea at 2.75 g/L were the optimum values to meet the criteria. At the initial yeast cell concentration of ~ 1 × 108 cells/mL, the PE, QP and SC were 97.06 g/L, 3.24 g/L·h and 95.43%, respectively. Repeated-batch fermentations showed that the ethanol production efficiency of eight successive cycles with and without aeration were not significantly different when the initial sugar of cycles 2 to 8 was under NG conditions (~ 140 g/L). Positive effects of aeration were observed when the initial sugar from cycle 2 was under HG conditions (180–200 g/L). The PE and QP under no aeration were consecutively lower from cycle 1 to cycle 6. Additionally, aeration affected ergosterol formation in yeast cell membrane at high ethanol concentrations, whereas trehalose content under all conditions was not different.\n\nConclusion\nInitial sugar, sufficient nitrogen and appropriated aeration are necessary for promoting yeast growth and ethanol fermentation. The SSJ was successfully used as an ethanol production medium for a high level of ethanol production. Aeration was not essential for repeated-batch fermentation under NG conditions, but it was beneficial under HG conditions.",

The physicochemical and structural properties of the tomato tissue were determined after fermentation and the bioaccessibility of lycopene was monitored using a simulated gastrointestinal tract. A lycopene concentration of 45.1 mg/100 g was obtained under optimal fermentation conditions. The cell walls of the tomato cells were hydrolyzed and disrupted by fermentation. Cell disruption decreased the pectin content and reduced the tissue fragment size, thereby reducing gravitational separation and facilitating lycopene release. The lycopene bioaccessibility in the tomato juices increased in the following order: unfermented (8.5%) < fermented (11.4%) < unfermented-emulsified (13.6%) < fermented-emulsified (22.7%). These effects were attributed to a combination of greater tomato tissue disruption and enhanced mixed micelle formation.

        "abstract": "During the past few years, entomophagy has been increasing in significance. As insects are generally high in protein, they are principally considered as meat substitutes. Nevertheless, in Western countries, meat substitute consumption is actually very low, principally due to food neophobia and poor sensory qualities in comparison with meat. In insect particular case, food neophobia is clearly high. To reduce insect food neophobia, previous studies suggest to insert invisible insect in food preparation and/or to associate them with known flavors. In this study, a survey on entomophagy perception and hedonic tests were realized to assess the level of sensory-liking of hybrid insect-based burgers (beef, lentils, mealworms and beef, mealworms and lentils). Participants’ overall liking of the four burgers differed between genders and was influenced by burger appearance and taste. Women clearly preferred beef burger appearance, whereas men preferred the appearance of beef and insect-based burgers. Concerning insect-based burger taste, participants (men and women) rated it intermediately, between that of the beef and lentil burger, with a preference for the mealworm and beef burger. Results also showed that people with previous entomophagy experience was limited but that they gave globally higher ratings to all preparations. In conclusion, insect tasting sessions are important to decrease food neophobia, as they encourage people to ‘‘take the first step” and become acquainted with entomophagy. Nevertheless, insect integration into Western food culture will involve a transitional phase with minced or powdered insects incorporated into ready-to-eat preparations, as people are not ready to add insects to their diets in ‘‘whole form.”",

The snacks, which were presented as pictures in an online survey, differed in their degree of processing of the insect ingredient: tortilla chips made of cricket flour (“flour”), tortilla chips containing deep-fried cricket bits (“bits”), a snack consisting of tortilla chips and deep-fried crickets (“mix”), and deep-fried crickets (“crickets”). Swiss respondents (N = 428) made 39 emotional evaluations, rated willingness to eat and expected liking of the presented products. Each participant evaluated the same non-insect-containing snack (within-subjects design) and one of four insect-containing snacks (between-subjects design). Results showed that the insect snacks evoked various negative emotional expectations that went beyond expectations of disgust. Positive emotional expectations were less expected to occur. Furthermore, expectations related to disgust/uneasiness, inertia/dissatisfaction, and positive emotional evaluations were significant predictors of willingness to eat. The degree of processing of the insect ingredient partly influenced the ratings, with the “mix” product being assessed more negatively than the “flour” or “bits” products. The “cricket” product was rated more positive than expected.\n\nThe research indicates that in the development and marketing of insect food, efforts should be undertaken not only to eliminate initial negative expectations of disgust and dissatisfaction but also to generate positive emotional expectations. We suggest the marketing of snacks containing processed insect ingredients will be more promising, and selling whole insects alone is more preferable to selling a mixed snack. Regardless of the degree of processing of the insect ingredient, the results suggest that marketing activities must contend with a large emotional barrier.",

        "abstract": "Insects are energy-efficient and sustainable sources of animal protein in a world with insufficient food resources to feed an ever-increasing population. However, much of the western world refuses to eat insects because they perceive them as disgusting. This research finds that both animal reminder disgust and core disgust reduced people's willingness to attend a program called “Bug Appetit \u0001 ” in which insects were served as food. Additionally, people who were low in sensitivity to animal reminder disgust were more willing to attend this program after having been primed to think about cooking. Cooking is a process by which raw ingredients are transformed into finished products, reducing the “animalness” of meat products that renders them disgusting. Sensitivity to core disgust did not interact with cooking to influence willingness to attend the program. While prior research has emphasized that direct education campaigns about the benefits of entomophagy (the consumption of insects) can increase willingness to attend events at which insect-based food is served, this is the first demonstration that indirect priming can have a similar effect among a subset of the population",

CMA exendin-4 (3e39) infusion reduced the effect of CMA GLP-1. Finally GLP-1R expression was found throughout the GI tract.

Previous research on consumers' meat choices has mainly focused on meat species, while consumer preferences for meat cuts has so far only received limited interest. The aim of this study is to shed some light into this relatively unexplored area by answering four research questions. First, this study intends to show the relative importance meat cuts play in relation to other extrinsic product attributes. Secondly, this paper looks into differences in choice criteria between regular and special occasions. Third, consumer segments that differ in their preferences and beef purchase are identified, and, finally, the meat purchase portfolios of these segments are revealed. A stated preference methodology of a discrete choice experiment with cut-specific prices covering several meat cuts simultaneously is proposed to answer the research questions. The sample consists of 1500 respondents representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender and geographic location The results shows that meat cut is the most important factor when choosing bovine meat followed by quality certification (origin), production technique, the type of breed and price. In terms of consumption occasions, we observe significantly lower price sensitivity for marbled steaks and cutlets for special occasions compared to normal occasions. Segmentation analysis shows that while the choices of two segments (comprising about 40% of the sample) are mostly driven by extrinsic product attributes, the remaining segments are mostly driven by meat cuts. These varying preferences are also reflected in the purchase portfolios of the different segments, while less variability is detected from a socio-demographic perspective",

Understanding the factors that drive their desire to eat is key to limiting their reactions to available food. This study tested whether individual differences in sensitivity to hedonic food cues are cognitively based and, accordingly, can be regulated by blocking cognitive resources. To this end, one lab study (Study 1; N ¼ 91) and one field study (Study 2; N ¼ 63) measured sensitivity to hedonic food cues using the Power of Food Scale (PFS; Lowe et al., 2009) and assessed participants' appetitive responses to high-calorie food options. To test the role of cognitive elaboration of food cues, participants completed a menu-selection task to induce food cravings and then were free to elaborate those cravings (control group) or were blocked from doing so by cognitive distraction (playing Tetris, solving puzzles; experimental group). Compared to non-sensitive participants, sensitive participants displayed a greater attentional bias to high-calorie food (Study 1), reported stronger cravings (Study 2), and more often chose an unhealthy snack (Studies 1 & 2), but only when they had not been distracted. When distracted, all participants were similarly unresponsive to high-calorie food. This finding suggests that temptation can be effectively controlled by blocking people's cognitive resources, even for people highly sensitive to hedonic food cues.",

        "title": "Home food environment factors associated with the presence of fruit and vegetables at dinner: A direct observational study",
        "abstract": "Background: Little research exists about the factors influencing the foods available at family meals. This study examines the home food environment factors contributing to the presence of fruit and vegetables at family meals. Methods: Home food inventory (HFI) and survey data were collected from low-income, minority families (n ¼ 120) with children 6e12 years old. Observations from video-recorded family dinner meals, totaling 800 videos, were used to measure the frequency at which fruit and vegetables were served. Multiple regression was used to investigate how the fruit and vegetables in the HFI and other home food environment factors were related to the number of days fruit and vegetables were served at dinner during the observation period. Results: Availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables in the home were each found to be significantly associated with the presence of fruits and vegetables at family dinners. Of the fruit and vegetable categories (i.e., fresh, canned, or frozen), having fresh fruit and vegetables available in the home was found to be most strongly associated with serving fruit and vegetables at dinner, respectively. Higher parent intake of vegetables was associated with the presence of vegetables at dinners, and parent meal planning was associated with the presence of fruit at dinners. Conclusions: Increasing the availability and accessibility of fresh fruit and vegetables in the home may be an effective approach to increasing the presence of fruits and vegetables at family dinners, especially among low-income, minority households. It is also essential to understand why families are not using all fruits and vegetables (e.g., canned and frozen) available in the home for family meals. Family meals are a place to promote the increased presence of both fruit and vegetables.",

        "abstract": "Vending machine use has been associated with low dietary quality among children but there is limited evidence on its role in food habits of University students. We aimed to examine the nutritional value of foods sold in vending machines in a UK University and conduct formative research to investigate differences in food intake and body weight by vending machine use among 137 University students. The nutrient content of snacks and beverages available at nine campus vending machines was assessed by direct observation in May 2014. Participants (mean age 22.5 years; 54% males) subsequently completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess vending machine behaviours and food intake. Self-reported weight and height were collected. Vending machine snacks were generally high in sugar, fat and saturated fat, whereas most beverages were high in sugar. Seventy three participants (53.3%) used vending machines more than once per week and 82.2% (n 60) of vending machine users used them to snack between meals. Vending machine accessibility was positively correlated with vending machine use (r ¼ 0.209, P ¼ 0.015). Vending machine users, compared to non-users, reported a significantly higher weekly consumption of savoury snacks (5.2 vs. 2.8, P ¼ 0.014), fruit juice (6.5 vs. 4.3, P ¼ 0.035), soft drinks (5.1 vs. 1.9, P ¼ 0.006), meat products (8.3 vs. 5.6, P ¼ 0.029) and microwave meals (2.0 vs. 1.3, P ¼ 0.020). No between-group differences were found in body weight. Most foods available from vending machines in this UK University were of low nutritional quality. In this sample of University students, vending machine users displayed several unfavourable dietary behaviours, compared to non-users. Findings can be used to inform the development of an environmental intervention that will focus on vending machines to improve dietary behaviours in University students in the UK",

        "abstract": "Siblings may act as caregivers and role models during mealtimes, and develop caregiving skills by observing and imitating the behavior of their mothers. The objective of this study was to examine the association between maternal feeding behaviors and encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child during mealtimes. Index children aged 4e8 years (n ¼ 69) were videotaped while eating a routine evening meal at home with one sibling present. Encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child were coded from the videotapes. Mothers completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire and the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire. Poisson regression was used to examine the association of maternal Pressure to Eat, Restriction, Monitoring, Verbal Direction, and Coercion with number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child. Models were adjusted for index child's age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and maternal education. Results showed that maternal Pressure to Eat (Rate Ratio (RR): 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19, 1.69), Restriction (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.60), Verbal Direction (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.68, 2.47), and Coercion (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.92) were each positively associated with the number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child. Maternal Monitoring was not associated with the number of encouragements to eat delivered from the sibling to the index child (RR: 0.92, 97% CI: 0.78, 1.09). Findings suggest that maternal behavior during mealtimes may affect the index child indirectly by shaping the behavior of siblings. Since controlling feeding behaviors have been associated with greater child obesity risk, future studies may evaluate the compounded effect of experiencing controlling feeding behaviors from both mothers and siblings.",

The fraction contained four isomeric derivatives of linoleic acid each containing a conjugated double-bond system (designated CLA). Synthetically prepared CLA (containing all four isomers) was tested for anti-initiation activity in the two-stage mouse epidermal carcinogenesis system. Seven days, 3 days and 5 min prior to DMBA application, CLA was applied at doses of 20, 20 and 10mg respectively. Control mice were treated similarly with linoleic acid or solvent (acetone). One week after initiation, and twice weekly thereafter, all mice were treated with 12- O -tetrade-canoylphorbol-13-acetate to effect tumor promotion. There was no difference in tumor incidence or yield between linoleic acid-treated mice and solvent-treated control mice.

        "abstract": "Beef jerky is a convenient, ready-to-eat meat product, but requires processing lethality steps to ensure the safety of the product. Previous outbreaks involving various jerky products have highlighted the risks associated with jerky and the importance of utilizing pathogen interventions during processing. In this study, two alternative interventions were evaluated for reducing pathogen populations during jerky processing. Results demonstrated that high pressure processing (HPP; two treatments of 550 MPa, 60 s) could produce significant (p < 0.05), but variable reductions (6.83 and 4.45 log10 CFU/strip) of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7, respectively, on resulting beef jerky. HPP treatments, however, produced minor reductions (p < 0.05) of Gram-positive pathogens, resulting in reductions of 1.28 and 1.32 log10 CFU/strip of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alternatively, boiling water (100 \u0001 2 C) treatments (20e30 s) used after marination and prior to dehydration, reduced Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus populations >5.0 log10 CFU/strip in resulting beef jerky. Thus, 20 or 30 s boiling water (100 \u0001 2 C) treatments could be effective interventions for commercial jerky processors or home food preservers. Future validation of these processes in-plant could provide processors and regulators with alternative strategies for safe and shelfstable jerky products",

No aflatoxins were detected in all samples of imported baby cereal and locally processed de-hulled maize flour. However, all locally processed maize based baby foods had aflatoxins above EU maximum tolerable level of 0.1 mg/kg. In 75% of locally processed maize puffs, aflatoxins were detected at levels of up to 2 mg/kg. Peanut based therapeutic foods had aflatoxin level between 1.6 and 2.9 mg/kg, exceeding the EU tolerable maximum level (0.1 mg/kg) set for food for health purposes. Locally processed peanut butters had aflatoxins levels in the range of 34.2e115.6 mg/kg, which was significantly higher than their imported counterparts (<0.2e4.3 mg/kg). Samples of locally processed skinned and de-skinned roasted groundnuts had aflatoxins in range of 0.5e2.5 mg/kg and 0.6e36.9 mg/kg, respectively.

This approach can be used on its own or combined with pressure and temperature (i.e. manothermosonication (MTS)). Microbial inactivation kinetics by sonication remains unclear. In the present study, a central composite response surface model (ccRSM) was used in order to study the effects of temperature (20e52 \u0001C), acoustic intensity (60e120 W/cm2 ) and treatment time (40e240 s) at a constant pressure (225 kPa) by MTS processing on microbial inactivation. Reductions of up to c. 1.6 log CFU/ml were achieved for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Lower inactivation values were reported for Staphylococcus aureus (1.05 log CFU/ml). These inactivation values were achieved using conditions of 36 \u0001C, 90 W/cm2 and 240 s. Inactivation of E. coli by MTS (R2 ¼ 0.90) was described by an exponential curve, whereas inactivation of S. aureus and P. fluorescens by MTS (R2 0.73) were described by a linear trend. The coefficient of determination values were obtained following validation between the theoretical model and the experimental values. Statistical analysis showed that treatment time was the factor with greatest influence on microbial inactivation for all three microorganisms. The present study confirms the suitability of using ccRSM as a tool for investigating and predicting the inactivation of E. coli, S. aureus and P. fluorescens as a function of temperature, acoustic power and treatment time, and may also be useful for predicting inactivation of other microorganisms commonly found in raw milk.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether reduction in numbers of total Escherichia coli found on beef could be regarded as indicative of the reduction in numbers of verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) resulting from the same heat treatment. Swab samples were collected from hide-on beef carcasses and were enriched for E. coli in E. coli broth supplemented with novobiocin. Suspensions containing cells in the stationary phase were mixed with equal volumes of meat juice medium and the mixtures were not heated or were heated at temperatures between 55 and 70 \u0001C. All preparations were treated with deoxycholate and propidium monoazide (PMA), then DNA was extracted. Real-time PCR was performed using primers targeting the uidA gene for total E. coli, the stx1 and stx2 genes for VTEC, and the eae gene for O157. For samples that were not subjected to heat treatment, cycle threshold (Ct) values were from 13.53 to 17.93 for uidA, 17.94 to 26.77 for stx1, 21.57 to 29.36 for stx2, and 23.53 to 28.31 for eae. Ct values for all genes were higher for heat treated than for not treated portions of samples. Differences between Ct values for not treated and heat treated portions of each sample were 5.06e7.57 for uidA, 4.35 to 7.03 for stx1, 4.49 to 7.12 for stx2 and 4.75 to 6.77 for eae. Differences between the increases of Ct values for pairs of genes in the sample were 0.32e0.83 for uidA and stx1, 0.19e0.57 for uidA and stx2 and 0.31e0.80 for uidA and eae. The maximum change in the ratio of Ct values for uidA and stx1, stx2 or eae as a result of heating corresponded to a change of 0.3 log units, which is less than the 0.5 log units generally considered to be microbiologically significant. Therefore, the findings indicate that reductions as a result of mild or pasteurizing heat treatments of total E. coli populations derived from beef can be regarded as indicative of the reductions in sub-populations of O157-VTEC and total VTEC resulting from the treatments.",

Most strains also showed a biofilm-forming ability higher than S. aureus ATCC 6538 e reference strain in bactericidal standard tests e by crystal violet staining. In addition, it seems that food-processing could have produced a selective pressure and strains with a high biofilm-forming ability were more likely found in highly handled and processed products. The efficacy of the industrial disinfectants benzalkonium chloride (BAC), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and peracetic acid (PAA) against biofilms and planktonic counterparts was also examined in terms of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. Biofilms showed an antimicrobial resistance higher than planktonic cells in all cases. However, no correlation was found between MBEC and MBC, likely due to differences in biofilm extracellular matrix (composition, content and architecture) between strains. BAC resistance increased as biofilms aged. Generally, biofilm formation seemed to attenuate the effect of low temperatures on BAC resistance. PAA was found to be most effective against both biofilms and planktonic cells, followed by NaClO and BAC. Resistance did not follow the same order for each biocide, which remarks the need of using a wide collection of strains in standard tests of bactericidal activity to ensure a proper application of disinfectants. Doses recommended by manufacturers for BAC, PAA and NaClO to disinfect food-contact surfaces were lower than doses for complete biofilm removal (i.e. MBEC) under some environmental conditions common in the food industry, which questions bactericidal standard tests and promotes the search for new strategies for biofilm removal.",

Trace amounts of undeclared pistachio allergens can cause serious health risks for food-allergic consumers. In order to provide an appropriate method for the detection of pistachio in food products, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the specific and sensitive detection of pistachio was developed.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyze stable isotope ratios and multi-element concentrations in pork. Based on the limited database of analytical values, the methodology would be potentially able to confirm whether a sample of pork came from the region and organic status it claimed.

Feeding DCP significantly increased the proportion of conjugated linoleic acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids in beef. Lipid and colour stability of fresh beef patties stored in modified atmosphere packs (MAP) were unaffected by dietary treatment but feeding 40% DCP reduced (P < .05) lipid oxidation in aerobically-stored cooked beef patties. Beef patties stored in MAP for up to 7 days were assessed by sensory panellists to be juicier for those fed 40% DCP compared to 0% and 80% DCP.

The treated wash showed a substantial increase in lactic, acetic and succinic acids Sensory analysis determined that the spirit produced with bacterial treatment were significantly different (p < 0.05) and chemical analysis demonstrated an increase in the production of ethyl acetate. These results show that pre-treatment using species of Lactobacillus could be utilised to alter the quality of new-make spirit in a distillery. By using bacterial cultures present in the surroundings or raw materials, distillers could allow naturally occurring or commercially available microflora to be added thus enhancing flavour development during fermentation and producing different spirit characters.",

Co-cultures of D. bruxellensis/S. cerevisiae were conducted under conditions commonly found in barrel aged beer production: different pitching rates, high glucose concentration and presence of ethanol and wood extracts. Selective pressures and competition between yeasts influenced microbial growth and metabolite production, namely ethanol, acetic acid and target volatile compounds (esters, alcohols, terpenols, volatile acids and volatile phenols). Metabolic profiles of co-cultures combined traits of both species, and differed from those of pure cultures.

        "abstract": "High-gravity (HG) brewing has broader application to succeed on beer differentiation and production optimization. However, such process imposes a handicap to yeasts, which must be able to deal with stressful conditions in fermentation. In this work, we assessed different physiological traits of 24 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from Brazilian bioethanol distilleries for the selection of novel starters for HG brewing. Five yeast strains were selected with ability to overcome different stressors under HG beer fermentation, showing high fermentability rates, resilience to ethanol stress, low production of foam and hydrogen sulfide, as well as similar flocculation rates to brewer's yeasts. After five fermentation recycles, most strains sustained a viability rate higher than 90% and were able to efficiently accumulate trehalose and glycogen, besides presenting no detectable petite mutants at the final stage. In the sensory analysis, the beers obtained from the five selected strains showed greater aromatic complexity, with predominance of ‘spicy’, ‘dried’ and ‘fresh fruits’ descriptors. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential of yeast strains from Brazilian bioethanol process to produce distinctive specialty beers, aside from proposing an effective selection methodology based on relevant physiological attributes for HG brewing process.",

Due to the short ripening time, pasteurization is necessary to eliminate the potential pathogenic bacteria, which may be present in raw milk, causing also the reduction of ripened cheese flavor. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of a selected wild Lactobacillus paracasei strain experimentally used as adjunct culture to enhance the flavour formation in a short-ripened caciotta-type cheese. An integrated polyphasic approach was used to compare the experimental and control Caciotta produced in a company located in Emilia Romagna region (Italy). It was demonstrated how the L. paracasei 4341 was able to develop in curd and cheese interacting with the acidifying commercial starter. The main acidifying starter species, were differently affected by the presence of the adjunct culture. Streptococcus thermophilus shown comparable behavior in all cheese-making step of control and experimental Caciotta, while Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus, growth was slowed down by the presence of the adjunct culture during the whole ripening time. The higher amount of volatile compounds and organic acids due to the adjunct L. paracasei 4341 lead to a clear differentiation of the experimental Caciotta respect to the control, in terms of aromatic profile, color, texture and sensorial perception.",

        "abstract": "Stabilizers are routinely added during cream cheese manufacture to help prevent syneresis during storage. We investigated how different types of stabilizers affected the texture, rheology, and sensory properties of cream cheese. Cream cheeses were manufactured with 0.33% xanthan gum (XG), locust bean gum (LBG), guar gum (GG), or a combination (CBN) of these 3 stabilizers (0.11% of each). Rheological properties of solutions of the individual stabilizers and their combination (equal amounts) were also determined under conditions similar to the aqueous phase of cream cheese (0.6% gum, 1.8% NaCl, and pH 5). Dynamic small amplitude rheological properties of the cream cheeses were measured during heating from 5 to 80°C at the rate of 1°C/ min and cooling at the same rate (since most cream cheese is hot packed/filled before cooling). Measured rheological parameters included storage modulus (G′) and loss tangent. Hardness of cream cheeses was determined by texture profile analysis. Quantitative spectrum descriptive sensory analysis was also performed. Distinct differences were observed between the rheological properties of solutions of the individual stabilizers and the CBN containing all the stabilizers. Results showed that CBN solution formed a strong, thermally reversible gel due to synergistic interaction between stabilizers, whereas XG solution formed a weak gel that was not greatly affected by temperature. Solutions of LBG and GG behaved rheologically as entangled polymer solutions. In the high-temperature (>35°C) region, cream cheeses made with XG and CBN showed higher G′ values compared with other cream cheeses. The G′ values were higher for XG- and CBN-stabilized cream cheeses than LBG- and GG-stabilized cream cheeses at several temperature regions during the cooling cycle. The CBN-stabilized cream cheeses had higher hardness values than the cream cheeses manufactured with the individual stabilizers. Differences were observed between the sensory attributes of cream cheeses stabilized with CBN and those made with individual stabilizers. At low temperatures, the higher hardness and G′ values of CBN-stabilized cream cheeses could be due to synergistic interaction between XG and galactomannans. The higher elasticity of XG-stabilized cream cheeses at high temperatures could be due to its higher thermal stability. This study showed that the stabilizers added during manufacture of cream cheese affected its texture, rheological, and sensory properties.",

        "abstract": "At the beginning of lactation, high-performing dairy cows often experience a severe energy deficit, which in turn is associated with metabolic stress. Increasing feed intake (FI) or reducing the energy deficit during this period could improve the metabolic stability and thus the health of the animals. Genomic selection for the first time enables the inclusion of this hard-to-measure trait in breeding programs. The objective of the current study was the estimation of genetic parameters and genomic breeding values for FI and energy balance (EB). For this purpose, 1,374 Holstein Friesian (HF) dairy cows from 8 German research farms were phenotyped with standardized FI data protocols. After data editing, phenotypic data of HF comprised a total of 40,012 average weekly FI records with a mean of 21.8 ± 4.3 kg/d. For EB 33,376 average weekly records were available with a mean of 3.20 ± 29.4 MJ of NEL/d. With the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) 1,128 of phenotyped cows were genotyped. Thirty-five female candidates of the HF population were genotyped but not phenotyped. Pedigree information contained sires and dams 4 generations back. The random regression animal model included the fixed effects of herd test week (alternatively, herd group test week), parity, and stage of lactation, modeled by the function according to Ali and Schaeffer (1987). For both the random permanent environmental effect across lactations and the random additive genetic effect, third-order Legendre polynomials were chosen. Additionally, a random permanent environmental cow effect within lactation was included. Analyses for heritabilities, genetic correlations between different lactation stages, and breeding values were estimated using, respectively, pedigree relationships and single-step genomic evaluation, carried out with the DMU software package (Madsen et al., 2013). This allowed for comparison of conventional reliabilities with genomic-assisted reliabilities based on real data, to evaluate the gain of genotyping. Heritability estimates ranged between 0.12 and 0.50 for FI, and 0.15 and 0.48 for EB, and increased toward the end of lactation. Genetic correlations were weak between early and late lactation, with a value of 0.05 for FI and negative with a value of −0.05 for EB. Reliabilities for genomic values of cows for FI and EB ranged between 0.33 and 0.61, and 0.27 and 0.47, respectively. For the genotyped cows without phenotypes, the inclusion of genomic relationship leads to an increase of the average reliability of the breeding value for FI by nearly 9% and for EB by 4%. The results show the possibility of combining pedigree, genotypes, and phenotypes for increasing FI or EB to reduce health and reproductive problems, especially at the beginning of lactation. Nevertheless, the reference population needs to be extended to reach higher breeding value reliabilities.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate production responses to supplementation of 2 AA groups in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Eight cows (99 ± 18 days in milk) were assigned to 4 jugular infusion treatments consisting of saline (CON), methionine plus lysine plus histidine (MKH), isoleucine plus leucine (IL), or MKH plus IL, in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Periods were 18 d in length, comprising 8 d of rest followed by 10 d of jugular infusion. Daily infusion amounts were 21 g of methionine, 38 g of lysine, 20 g of histidine, 50 g of leucine, and 22 g of isoleucine. Cows were ad libitum fed a common diet consisting of 15.2% crude protein and 1.61 Mcal/kg NEL on a dry matter basis that was predicted to meet rumen degradable protein requirements but was 15% deficient in metabolizable protein. Milk and energy-corrected milk yields increased by 2.3 kg/d and 1.9 kg/d, respectively, with infused IL, and no change was observed for MKH. Milk protein concentration increased by 0.13 percentage units for MKH, whereas milk protein yield increased for both MKH and IL by 84 g/d and 64 g/d, respectively. The milk protein yield increase for MKH+IL was 145 g/d versus CON. Gross feed efficiency tended to increase with IL infusion, and N efficiency tended to increase with MKH infusion. Aggregate arterial EAA concentrations less Met, Lys, and His declined by 7.2% in response to MKH infusion. Arterial EAA less Ile and Leu also declined by 6.2% in response to IL infusion. Net total AA (TAA) and EAA uptake by the udder tended to increase in response to MKH infusion, whereas mammary blood flow increased in response to IL infusion, but TAA and EAA net uptakes were unaffected. Apparent udder affinity increased for TAA and EAA less Met, Lys, and His in response to MKH infusion, whereas affinity for EAA less Ile and Leu increased for IL infusion. Venous Met and Leu concentrations increased by 192% and 35% from the MKH and IL infusions, respectively, compared with CON, which indicates that intracellular concentration of these EAA changed substantially. Increases in milk protein yield were observed from 2 groups of amino acids independently and additively, which contradicts the single limiting amino acid theory that a single EAA will limit milk protein yield.",

Hyperketonemia could induce metabolic stress, which might indirectly affect mammary tissue. Autophagy is a highly conserved physiological process that results in the turnover of intracellular material, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis under the challenge of metabolic stress induced by NNB. The aim of this study was to investigate the autophagy status and autophagy-related pathways AMPactivated kinase α (AMPKα) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the mammary glands of dairy cows with hyperketonemia. Cows with hyperketonemia [CWH, n = 10, blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration 1.2 to 3.0 mmol/L] and cows without hyperketonemia (CWOH, n = 10, BHB < 1.2 mmol/L) from 3 to 12 DIM were randomly selected from the herd. The mammary tissue and blood samples were collected from these cows between 0630 and 0800 h, before feeding, at 3 to 12 d in milk. Serum concentrations of glucose, BHB, and fatty acids were determined using an autoanalyzer with commercial kits between 0630 and 0800 h, before feeding. Concentrations of fatty acids, BHB (median and interquartile range: CWH, 2.44 and 1.3, 2.82 mM; CWOH, 0.49 and 0.41, 0.57 mM), and milk fat were greater in CWH. The DMI, glucose concentration, milk production, and milk protein levels were lower in CWH.

The protein abundance of LC3-II and phosphorylation level of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) were greater in CWH, but the total ubiquitinated proteins and protein abundance of p62 were lower. Transmission electron microscopy showed an increased number of autophagosomes in the mammary glands of CWH. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AMPKα was greater, but the phosphorylation of mTOR was lower in the mammary glands of CWH. These results indicate that activity of mTOR pathways and autophagy activity, and upregulation of AMPKα, may be response mechanisms to mitigate metabolic stress induced by hyperketonemia in the mammary glands of dairy cows.",

Twenty-seven Holstein-Frisian calves were assigned to 3 groups: the control group without fat added to the diet (CON, n = 9), a group receiving ethyl esters of flax oil (10 g/d) with lyophilized apples (25 g; MRE), or a group receiving flax oil (10 g/d) with lyophilized apples (25 g; MRL). The study was conducted from d 14 to d 42 of life. Intake of MR and feed were recorded daily, and fecal scores, rectal temperature, and body weight were recorded weekly. Laboratory blood tests were conducted every 7 d from d 14 to 42. Supplementation with the formulation containing ethyl esters of flax oil (MRE) positively affected health, average daily weight gain, growth rate, and feed efficiency. Intake of the starter feed was lower in the calves receiving the formulation with flax oil (MRL). The MRE formulations lowered the concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL fraction in blood serum and decreased the total antioxidant capacity (TAS) and levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The MRL formulation increased TAS and GPx levels in blood serum. The MRE treatment limited the circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor. The MRE and MRL preparations lowered the concentration of SFA (C16:0, C18:0, C18:1) in blood serum, and MRE significantly increased levels of α-linolenic acid. The MRE and MRL preparations beneficially affected production and physiological parameters.

The PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ribosomal spacer PCR, RS-PCR) allows a rapid classification of the strains in genotypes and genotypic clusters (CL), which are characterized by different epidemiological and clinical properties. Both RS-PCR and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed on strains isolated from bovine bulk tank milk (BTM) collected from dairy herds located in the Lombardy region (northern Italy), to outline the distribution of Staph. aureus genotypes in this geographical area. Out of 844 examined samples, 398 were positive for Staph. aureus, with a variable number of cfu/mL. Up to 8 colonies from each sample were genotyped. A total of 1,101 Staph. aureus strains were analyzed with RS-PCR, and only a selection of them (n = 86), in relation to their frequency and geographical origin, underwent MLST. This study revealed 8 major genotypic clusters (CLB, CLC, CLR, CLS, CLI, CLF, CLAO, and CLZ), of which Staph. aureus CLB (29.3%) was the most common. Samples of BTM positive for CLB had a Staph. aureus cfu/mL count significantly higher than the non-CLB positive ones. Our MLST analysis showed genotypes already known as bovine-associated in literature, such as clonal complexes CC8, CC97, and CC151. The same selection of 86 strains was also analyzed for the presence of the adlb gene, which was recently proposed as a possible marker of contagiousness. Most Staph. aureus belonging to CLB or CC8 carried the adlb gene (85%), whereas this gene was detected in only 9% of non-CLB strains (CLAA, CLBI, CLBJ, CLS). In conclusion, the present study confirms that Staph. aureus CLB, which is recognized as a contagious genotype, is a particularly relevant agent of intramammary infection in dairy cows in Lombardy, and indirectly supports the idea that adlb can be a possible marker of contagiousness of isolates.",

        "abstract": "A total of 1440 eggs were obtained from two different marketing channels, four supermarkets and grocery stores located in different area of Riyadh city during summer and winter seasons of 2018/2019. Thirty eggs were collected from each marketing channel/ month during winter and summer seasons. Eggs collected from each marketing channel were numbered individually, weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. Thereafter, the eggs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 30 eggs (replicates) each. The eggs in the different experimental groups were either immediately analyzed (Control, time zero), stored for 7 or 14 days in refrigerator at 4–6 \u0001C and 40–60% relative humidity to simulate egg consumption pattern of Saudi Arabian’s families. Egg weight, Haugh unit values, Albumin pH cleanness, and soundness grade percentages and egg price were determined for all individual eggs in each experimental groups at the end of storage period than egg quality and weight grades were classified according to GCC. The results indicated that seven and fourteen days of storage period led to a significant (p \u0001 0.05) decrease large egg weight, AA and A Haugh unit and albumin pH percentages grades, whereas moderate egg weight, B and C Haugh unit and albumin pH percentages grades increased with increased storage period. On other the hand, eggs purchased from supermarket stores had significantly (p \u0001 0.05) higher AA and A Haugh unit, albumin pH, moderate egg weight, broking of soundness grad percentage than those purchased from grocery stores. They also have lower B and C Haugh unit and albumin pH, very large, large and small egg weight, dirty of cleanness and cracked of soundness grades percentages than those obtained from grocery stores. Eggs obtained in winter season had significantly (p \u0001 0.05) higher AA and A. Haugh unit and albumin pH, large and large egg weight spots of dirt grades percentages but have lower B and C Haugh unit and pH and small weight grades percentages and egg price than those purchased in summer season. From the results reported herein, we conclude that storage period, marketing channel and season play a significant role in affecting quality traits of Table eggs marketed in Riyadh city. Table eggs purchased from supermarkets and in winter season showed better quality than those obtained from grocery stores and in summer season, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is a strategically important economic sector and a type of economic activity for every country. The level of its development determines food security and country independence, population well-being and health, demographic and economic development. Steady growth and development of agriculture can be characterized only by a system of indicators and indices, allowing to compare different regions. The study describes the method to calculate an integration index of agricultural development by an example of the Russian Federation regions’ ranking. The authors offer a system of indicators and prove the need to use different components and their sub-indices of a lower level. There were made calculations and rating to distinguish between regions with different level of agricultural development. The authors claim that farm producers should rely both on climatic conditions and on capacity and advantages of technical, technological and scientific modernization of the industry. There are ways to improve the integration index method to calculate development of agriculture. The calculation of the proposed integration index makes provisions for a generalized assessment of the potential of different industries in the regions. It can identify the most promising directions for development of economic sectors at the state level. This method can be applied to different industries in the territorial context of other countries. It can be used for cross-country comparisons, as well as for the analysis of indicators in the long-term dynamics. The integration index calculation will contribute to better information and analytical support for the industry functioning, as well as procedural and methodological aspects of the analysis",

        "abstract": "Due to some biological characteristics of the brown-marbled grouper, there are challenges in aquaculture enterprises focused on production of this fish. With the aim of facilitating captive breeding in brown-marbled grouper, effects on gamete post-activation, post-stripping egg storage and sperm to egg ratio on fertilization success were investigated. Results indicated eggs were fertile for 4 min after placement in seawater, thereafter, there was a reduction in fertilization. Initial curvilinear velocity (VCL) and total motility of fresh sperm was 129.3 ± 3.7 μm/s and 92.9 ± 2.4%, both of which decreased as time elapsed post-activation, however, there was no significant difference in fertilization until 6 min post-activation of sperm. Compared with fertilization and hatching rates in eggs used immediately after collection (95.0 ± 2.8% and 90.1 ± 4.2%), in vitro storage of eggs had no detectable effect on fertilized egg and hatching rates until 60 min post-stripping (92.0 ± 2.8% and 89.9 ± 2.7%), indicating that immediate use of brown-marbled grouper eggs for fertilization is not necessary in aquaculture hatcheries. With regard to optimizing the sperm to egg ratio, there was acceptable fertilization with ratios ranging from 103 to 107, whereas there was a marked decrease in fertilization rate when there were lesser sperm concentrations. When the combined results from this study are considered, there could be improvements of artificial fertilization efficiency in the brown-marbled grouper with utilization of these findings in aquaculture enterprises focused on production of this fish.",

        "abstract": "Studies have evaluated the effects of zinc (Zn) supplementation as an important dietary factor that regulates intestinal amino acid metabolism, protecting and preventing diarrhea. Threonine (Thr) also plays an important role in intestinal mucosa, playing a key role in the innate immune defence of mucosa. Thus, the present study evaluated the combined effects of Thr and chelated Zn on egg production and egg quality of brown laying hens from 20 to 48 weeks and on nutrient balance at week 49. The hypothesis was that a lower level of Zn chelated in the diet could be favorable for the use of Thr by laying hens. Thus, two experimental designs were made. Experiment number 1: A completed randomized design with six replicate cages per treatment was done. The structure of the treatment was a 4 × 5 factorial arrangement with five levels of total Thr (6.14, 6.98, 8.75, 10.06 and 10.55 g/kg) and four analyzed levels of Zn (31, 73, 104 and 121 mg / kg). A total of 120 cages was used. Each cage had eight hens. In this experiment the experimental unit was the cage with 8 hens. The response variables analyzed were related to egg production and quality. Experiment number 2: It was identical to experiment 1, but only four repetitions were used per treatment and each cage had 4 hens. The experimental unit was the cage with 4 hens. The response variables analyzed were related to the nutrient balance, and apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen (AMEN). An interaction effect between Zn and Thr levels was observed on egg production, egg weight, nitrogen balance and AMEN. Quadratic equations indicated that increasing dietary levels of Zn reduced Thr estimates for hens. General performance results suggest a total Thr concentration of 8.38 ± 0.43 g/kg or 880 ± 43 mg/day, however, a level of chelated Zn above 40 mg/kg negatively affected egg quality. Corn and soybean meal diet naturally provided the zinc requirement egg production. Higher Zn levels can reduce nutrient and energy intake and efficiency, limiting its retention by laying hens and affecting productive performance. As for interaction, the apparent lower estimate of Thr to ensure egg production and egg weight with increased Zn concentration in the diet may imply a gradual increase in Zn excretion. Thus, costs related to food and the environment must also be considered.",

        "abstract": "The aim was to study the effect of storage (high moisture airtight (HMA) storage vs. dry storage) and a combination of phytase, xylanase, β-glucanase, and protease on nutrient solubility and digestibility of barley. Experiment 1 studied the effect of HMA stored barley at 29%, 35%, and 40% moisture and enzyme combination to define the optimum moisture level for the maximum nutrient solubility of barley. The ‘35% moisture’ was chosen for HMA storage of barley because this treatment (without or with enzymes) enhanced phytate degradation (31–73%) and the solubility of P (125–177%), nitrogen (N) (95–125%) and protein (56–68%) compared to dry storage (P < 0.05) and at the same time seemed to prevent a loss of energy and N (ammonia) by microbial fermentation. In Exp. 2, 6 female growing pigs (43 ± 2 kg) were used per diet (8 diets, 48 pigs) in a 12-d nutrient digestibility study to assess the effect of HMA stored barley at 35% moisture and enzyme combination on coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of P in barley fed alone or together with soybean meal (SBM). Also, HMA storage of barley at ‘35% moisture’ without and with enzyme combination enhanced phytate degradation (43–58%) and P solubility (2.5–3.3 fold) (P < 0.05). Thus, HMA stored barley (solely endogenous enzymes) enhanced CTTAD of P to almost the same extent as dry stored barley with enzyme combination (endogenous enzymes plus added enzymes) in the barley diet (45–49%) and the barley-SBM diet (15–25%) (P < 0.05). Adding the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley achieved the greatest increase of CTTAD of P in the barley diet (70%) and the barley-SBM diet (36%) (P < 0.05). The inclusion of the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley tended to enhance the calculated CTTAD of P of SBM (29%) compared with no enzyme combination (P = 0.06) due to the lower endogenous enzymes activity in HMA stored barley. It is necessary to add the enzyme combination to enhance P digestibility of SBM when fed together with HMA stored barley. Overall, HMA storage with enzyme combination is a potential method to enhance P digestibility of barley in pigs to reduce the dietary need for inorganic P addition and P excretion to the environment.",

        "abstract": "The addition of phytase enzyme to broiler feed as a means of improving phosphorus (P) availability and reducing P excretion is widespread practice. New phytases with enhanced functionality continue to be developed. We tested the effects of a next generation biosynthetic bacterial 6-phytase on growth performance, tibia ash and P digestibility in broilers. Treatments included a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) diet, a negative control (NC) diet formulated with reductions in Ca and available P (avP) of 2.0 g/kg and 1.9 g/kg (starter phase) and 2.0 g/kg and 1.8 g/kg (finisher phase), respectively, and three further diets comprising the NC supplemented with three levels of phytase (250, 500 or 1000 FTU/kg). Diets were fed in mash form to day-old Cobb 500 broilers housed in pens (9 pens for NC, 10 pens for all other treatments; 24 birds/pen), in two phases (starter, days 1–21; finisher, days 22–42). Tibias were collected from 4 birds on day 21 and from 6 birds on day 42 for determination of defatted tibia ash. Ileal digesta was collected on day 21 for determination of apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients. Compared to PC, the NC exhibited reduced tibia ash at day 21 and 42, resulting in reduced average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during starter, finisher, and overall phases, and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) during finisher phase and overall (P < 0.05). Phytase at any dose-level during both phases improved tibia ash vs. NC (P < 0.05) and maintained feed intake and growth parameters equivalent to the PC. At a dose-level of 500 FTU/kg or above, phytase supplementation increased AID of P vs. NC (P < 0.05) and at 1000 FTU/kg, phytase improved the AID of P compared with PC (P < 0.05). For all measures, response values were numerically highest with 1000 FTU/kg and increased linearly or quadratically with increasing phytase dose (P < 0.05). Phytase at 1000 FTU/kg produced birds with an average day 42 body weight of 2.74 kg and overall FCR of 1.626, comparable to PC. On a grams per kilogram diet basis, phytase at 1000 FTU/kg improved ileal digestible P by 1.76 g/kg above NC (at day 21). This is equivalent to 2.07 g P from monocalcium phosphate (MCP-P), based on digestible P improvement. The results suggest the novel biosynthetic phytase has high functionality in the tested dietary setting.",

        "abstract": "Carinata meal, a co-product from carinata seed oil extraction plants, is available for livestock feeding. Also, cold-pressed canola expellers (Cold-pressed CME), a co-product from canola seed oil extraction plants, is available for livestock feeding. The nutritive value of carinata meal for pigs has not been reported. Also, there is limited information on the nutritive value of cold-pressed CME for pigs. The objective of this study was to determine standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) and net energy value of carinata meal and Cold-pressed CME for growing pigs. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (initial body weight = 32.7 ± 1.46 kg) were fed 3 diets a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design in combination with a 3 × 2 Youden square design, to give 8 replicates/diet. The diets were cornstarch-based, containing Cold-pressed CME or carinata meal as sole protein source, and N-free. Digestibility of AA in feedstuffs was determined by the direct method. Energy digestibility in Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal was determined by difference from the N-free diet. On dry matter basis (DM), Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal contained 396 and 502 g/kg crude protein, 207 and 268 g/kg neutral detergent fiber, 160 and 8.8 g/kg ether extract, 23.2 and 18.2 g/kg lysine, 7.4 and 9.6 g/kg methionine, 16.3 and 18.9 g/kg threonine, and 5.0 and 6.4 g/kg tryptophan, respectively. The Cold-pressed CME compared with carinata meal, had greater (P < 0.05) SID of lysine (0.744 vs. 0.601). Conversely, Cold-pressed CME compared with carinata meal, had lower (P < 0.05) SID of methionine (0.821 vs. 0.878) and tryptophan (0.818 vs. 0.898), and tended to be lower (P = 0.078) in SID of threonine. The Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal did not differ in coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility of gross energy (0.433 vs. 0.376). The Cold-pressed CME had lower (P < 0.05) coefficient of apparent total tract digestibility of GE than carinata meal (0.573 vs. 0.671). The Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal did not differ in digestible energy (12.99 vs. 12.83 MJ/kg). However, Cold-pressed CME had greater (P < 0.05) net energy value than carinata meal (8.20 vs. 6.74 MJ/kg DM). In conclusion, carinata meal has lower energy value than Cold-pressed CME, however, the former had greater SID of most AA than the latter. Both Cold-pressed CME and carinata meal can serve as alternative oilseed co-product feedstuffs for pigs.",

Test diets contained 4 g/ kg of TiO2 as a digestibility marker and protease (CIBENZA® DP100 at 300 U/g diet, Novus International). A randomized complete block design was analyzed using ANOVA with LSD multiple pair-wise comparison used to compare treatment means. For Exp 2 and 3, a common starter diet was fed to broiler chickens until d 16 of life and then switched to test diets. Exp 1 was a 2×6 factorial arrangement of 2 protease levels (0 and 300 U/g) and 6 dietary TI levels (0.72, 1.16, 1.61, 2.06, 2.50, and 2.95 mg/g) with 6 replicates/treatment; 8 chicks/pen. In Exp 2 (12 replicates/treatment; 8 chicks/pen), apparent ileal AA digestibility (AIAAD) was evaluated in diets containing 250 g/kg full fat extruded soybeans (FFES)+SBM (negative control; 5.8 mg/g TI) with or without protease or SBM (positive control; 3.1 mg/g TI). Test diets were fed from d 16–21 of age, AIAAD and relative pancreas weight was measured on d 21. In Exp. 3, broilers were allocated to a 2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments with 9 replicates/treatment and 8 chicks/ pen.

        "abstract": "The long-term unsustainability of fish oil as a lipid source in aquaculture feeds has led to its progressive replacement with vegetable oils. Several studies have shown that this replacement results in a different fatty acid profile that is likely to compromise the healthy properties and quality of fish by reducing their n-3 HUFA content. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of partial replacement of fish oil with vegetable oils on the quality of the final product. Eighty-four gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were fed one of two different commercial diets for 19 weeks in triplicate (14 fish per tank). These diets contained either 100 % fish oil (FO diet) or a 75 % vegetable oil blend (VO diet) (50/50 mixture of soybean and rapeseed oil). After slaughter, physical-chemical analyses (Fatty Acids (FAs); flesh color; Water-Holding Capacity (WHC); pH; and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA)) and a sensory analysis were performed. Fish fed either diet displayed similar growth and feed conversion rates (SGR and FCR). The fish fed the VO diet showed an increase in muscular n-6 fatty acids, which resulted in a lower n-3/n-6 ratio. A lower presence of EPA and DHA fatty acids was also observed, although the total quantity of n-3 fatty acids was similar in both groups. With regard to fat quality, the Atherogenic Index (AI) was lower in the VO-diet group, while both groups presented a similar Thrombogenic Index (TI). The diet had some effect on quality parameters, but the changes were not very intense. The differences observed in the a* and b* chromatic parameters were not significant, but a greater and significant color saturation in the vegetable oil group was observed. No significant differences in pH and WHC were observed. Fish fed the vegetal oil diet also scored higher for hardness, springiness, gumminess and chewiness. In the sensory analysis no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The differences observed for both the fatty acid profile and the quality parameters do not appear to have any important implications in terms of either health or the sensory properties of gilthead seabream fed a vegetable oil diet.",

Our objective was to assess the impact of different dietary Thr inclusion levels (70, 85, 100, 115, or 130% of the estimated ideal 0.65 Thr:Lys ratio) on growth performance, plasma biochemical parameters, and splanchnic and muscle AA composition in pigs raised in a conventional group phase feeding (GPF) system and in an individual precision feeding (IPF) system. A total of 110 finishing pigs (110 ± 7.02 kg initial body weight; 11 pigs per treatment) were housed in the same room for 21 d. Pigs were randomly assigned to a 2 × 5 factorial arrangement and fed using automatic feeders. Individual pigs were considered the experimental units. Five pigs per treatment were slaughtered at the end of the trial. The gain:feed ratio was not affected by feeding system, but there was a quadratic effect of Thr inclusion rate (P < 0.05). Lysine intake was 16% greater and Thr intake was 15% greater for the GPF pigs than for the IPF pigs (P < 0.05). Protein deposition (g/d) was not affected by any treatment. Protein deposition in daily gain was affected by the interaction between Thr inclusion rate and feeding system, with a quadratic (P < 0.05) effect for the GPF pigs and a cubic (P < 0.10) effect for the IPF pigs. The pigs in IPF consumed 14% less (P < 0.05) crude protein and excreted 17% less (P < 0.05) N than the GPF pigs did. The pigs in IPF retained 9% more (P < 0.05) N than the GPF pigs. Plasma urea values were 9% higher (P < 0.05) in GPF than those in IPF. The gamma-glutamyl transferase enzyme decreased (P < 0.05) in a quadratic manner within IPF but increased (P < 0.05) in a quadratic manner within GPF. In the IPF systems, the average concentration of albumin and C-reactive protein tended (P < 0.10) to be 2 and 22% lower, respectively, than in GPF. Changes in amino acid concentrations occurred mainly in the liver of the IPF pigs. The pigs in IPF had higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of collagen in the longissimus dorsi than the pigs in GPF. Lastly, IPF allowed standardized ileal digestible Lys and Thr intakes to decrease by 16 and 15%, respectively, without differences in average daily gain and gain:feed ratio in comparison with GPF.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of supplemental Clostridium butyricum on production performance and intestinal absorption function of laying hens in the late phase of production. A total of 384 59-week-old Hy-Line Brown layers were randomly divided into 4 groups that consisted of 8 replicates with 12 birds each. Birds were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.3, 0.9 or 2.7 g/kg C. butyricum (the actual bacterial count was 9.3 × 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/g). The experiment lasted for 8 weeks after a 1-week adaptation period. Results showed that increasing C. butyricum addition resulted in a quadratic reduction (P < 0.05) of feed conversion ratio of layers from weeks 5 to 8 and from weeks 1 to 8, concurrent with quadratic elevations (P < 0.05) in yolk color, ileal villus height, ileal lipase and alkaline phosphatase activities of layers at the end of week 8. These responses were maximized at medium dose (0.9 g/kg) of C. butyricum addition. Furthermore, there were quadratic increases (P < 0.05) in ileal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and sodium-potassium ATPase activity, along with the relative mRNA expression of ileal L-type amino acid transporter-1 and fatty acid-binding protein-1 of layers at the end of week 8 due to the increase of C. butyricum addition, with 0.9 g/kg being the most effective. In conclusion, dietary C. butyricum supplementation could improve feed efficiency and yolk color of laying hens in the late phase of production probably through the promotion of intestinal absorption function. The optimal dose of C. butyricum in layer diet in the present study was 0.9 g/kg (8.37 × 108 CFU/kg).",

Heme iron intake was associated significantly with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and the pooled relative risk (RR) for each 1 mg/day increment was 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.14, I2 = 59.7%). We also found evidence of a curvilinear association (P < 0.05 for non-linearity). In contrast, we found no association between CVD risk and dietary non-heme (0.98, 0.96 to 1.01, I2 = 15.8%) or total iron (1.00, 0.94 to 1.06, I2 = 30.4%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the association between heme iron intake and CVD risk was stronger among non-fatal cases (1.19, 1.07–1.33) and American patients (1.31, 1.11–1.56).\n\nConclusions\nHigher dietary intake of heme iron is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas no association was found between CVD and non-heme iron intake or total iron intake. These findings may have important public health implications with respect to preventing cardiovascular disease.",

        "title": "Graduate student literature review: The past and future of soy protein in calf nutrition",
        "abstract": "Our objective with this review is to encourage more research about the use of soy protein in young calf diets by learning from the mistakes of the past and acknowledging the promising results found when modern techniques are applied to treat soybeans. Total or partial substitution of milk proteins with soy proteins can represent a substantial increase in the economic efficiency of calf diets as long as it does not affect calf performance. Unfortunately, the results found in the literature indicate that the inclusion of soy protein in diets of young calves usually diminishes growth and health outcomes. The interaction of the antinutritional factors and antigenic proteins in soybeans with the gastrointestinal tract triggers a physiological response with negative consequences for the digestive tract and immune system of the calf. In this article, we highlight the importance of a correct processing method of soybeans by reviewing some of the published research that has evaluated different soy-based ingredients in diets for young calves. Conventional methods such as heating, ethanol extraction, and protein isolation can produce favorable results provided that the final product contains minimum or null amounts of antigenic and antinutritional factors. More recently, further processing methods such as microbial treatment of soybean meal reduces those antinutritional and antigenic factors, and can also increase the quality of soy protein by reducing the peptide size and by triggering the release of bioactive compounds. Experiments in which soy protein modified by this method was fed have increased in the scientific literature during the last decade due to the favorable results obtained in calves as well as in monogastric animals.",

However, epidemiological evidence of a link between dietary soy isoflavone and type 2 diabetes is not convincing. This study aimed to evaluate the prospective associations between intake of dietary soy protein and isoflavones (total isoflavones, daidzein and genistein) and risk of type 2 diabetes in a community-based cohort of Korean adults aged \u0001 40 years, the Korean Multi-Rural Communities Cohort (MRCohort). Methods: A total of 8269 participants who did not have type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Dietary intake was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: Over 50,063 person-years of follow-up, 531 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Significant doseeresponse inverse associations were observed between dietary soy protein and isoflavones (quartiles) and type 2 diabetes in women (incidence rate ratio, IRR ¼ 0.63, 95% CI ¼ 0.45e0.87, P for trend ¼ 0.0078 for soy protein; IRR ¼ 0.62, 95% CI ¼ 0.45e0.86, P for trend ¼ 0.0031 for total isoflavones for the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile). Similar significant linear trends were found for both daidzein and genistein. However, there were no significant associations with soy protein and isoflavones in men. The sex-specific differences in associations between soy protein and isoflavones intakes and type 2 diabetes risk were statistically significant (all P for interaction < 0.05). Conclusions: Habitual intake of soy protein and isoflavones may be inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women, but not in men. Dietary soy components may play different roles in the development of type 2 diabetes in men and women",

        "abstract": "Background: Milk as a common diet is recommended by many guidelines, but the results on the association of milk consumption with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer were contradictory. Moreover, evidence regarding milk consumption and mortality risk in Chinese is scarce.\n\nObjective: We examined the associations of milk consumption with the risk of all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality in a low milk consumption population using data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study.\n\nDesign: 18,214 participants aged 50+ years without CVD history at baseline (2003-6) were included. Causes of death were identified through record linkage. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nResults: Of the 18,214 participants, 12,670 (69.6%) did not consume milk, 2669 (14.7%) had moderate (1-3 portions/week; 1 portion = 250 ml) and 2875 (15.8%) had high (3+ portions/week) consumption. During an average follow-up of 11.5 (standard deviation = 2.3) years, 2697 deaths occurred, including 917 CVD and 1029 cancer deaths. Compared with no consumption, the adjusted HR (95% CIs) of all-cause, CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke mortality for moderate milk consumption was 0.92 (0.81-1.04), 0.72 (0.57-0.92), 0.57 (0.38-0.85) and 0.77 (0.63-0.94), respectively. High consumption was associated with a higher risk of total cancer and esophagus cancer mortality, with the adjusted HR (95% CIs) being 1.33 (1.12-1.57) and 3.20 (1.21-8.43) respectively. No significant association of high consumption with lung cancer, liver cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, or colorectal and anal cancer was found.\n\nConclusions: In our sample of Chinese with much lower milk consumption than those in the West, compared with no consumption, moderate milk consumption showed a lower risk of CVD mortality, but high milk consumption showed a higher risk of total cancer mortality. Further studies are warranted to verify the differential effects of milk on CVD and cancer.\n\nKeywords: Cancer; Cardiovascular disease; Ischemic heart disease; Milk consumption; Mortality; Stroke.",

        "abstract": "Field pea is an alternative starch and protein source for swine; however, feeding raw field pea to weaned pigs may reduce feed efficiency (G:F). Growth performance of weaned pigs fed field pea processed using treatments with heat and friction is unknown. To explore the effects of feed processing, field pea was ground (4.0-mm sieve), then either cold-pelleted (70–75 °C), steampelleted (80–85 °C) or extruded (115 °C) and then re-ground (3.2-mm sieve). Diets included 400 g per kg raw, cold-pelleted, steam-pelleted or extruded field pea replacing 300 g soybean meal (SBM) and 100 g wheat grain and were formulated to provide 10.0 MJ net energy (NE)/kg and 12.1 g standardised ileal digestible lysine/kg. In total, 236 pigs (weaned at 20 days of age) were housed in 60 pens in 4 rooms and fed 1 of 5 diets starting 2 weeks post-weaning [initial body weight (BW): 10 kg] for 3 weeks. The CATTD of gross energy and crude protein, digestible energy and predicted NE value were lower (P < 0.001) in field pea diets than in SBM diets and were not affected by processing of field pea. Overall (day 1–21), average daily feed intake of pigs fed raw or processed field pea diets (853–882 g/day) was greater (P = 0.001) than pigs fed SBM diet (813 g/day). Average daily gain did not differ between SBM diet and field pea diets, nor did it differ among field pea treatments. Thus, G:F was lower (P < 0.001) for pigs fed field pea diets (0.60–0.63) than for pigs fed SBM diet (0.68), but did not differ among field pea treatments. Final BW of pigs fed raw, cold-pelleted, steam-pelleted, extruded field pea and SBM diets were 21.0, 21.1, 21.3, 21.4 and 21.7 kg respectively. Final BW was not affected (P > 0.05) by feeding or processing of field pea. To conclude, weaned pigs fed 400 g field pea/kg diet in substitution of SBM could maintain growth performance. Greater ADFI for field pea diets than SBM diet indicated that pigs compensated for the reduced energy value of field pea diets. Raw field pea can be included in late nursery diets without thermal treatment to replace 300 g SBM and 100 g wheat grain/kg diet",

        "abstract": "A study was conducted to compare maize, wheat and sorghum as the main feed grain in standard phytase and xylanase supplemented diets for broiler chickens. Six diets with different grain varieties (two wheat, two sorghum and two maize) were formulated in accordance with Ross 308 recommendations for starter, grower and finisher diets and were offered from 1 to 10, 11–26 and 27–35 days post-hatch, respectively. The six treatments were offered to 672 male Ross 308 chicks, with eight replicate cages per treatment and 14 birds per cage from 1 to 10 days post-hatch and 6 birds per cage from 11 to 35 days post-hatch. Over the 1–35 day experimental period, birds offered diets based on maize B generated the most efficient feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1.380), whereas birds offered red sorghum-based diets generated the poorest FCR (1.478). Likewise, in the finisher phase, birds offered both maize and wheat generated significantly greater apparent metabolisable energy (AME, MJ/kg DM), AME to gross energy ratio (AME:GE, MJ/MJ) and nitrogen corrected AME (AMEn, MJ/kg DM) than birds offered sorghum-based diets. Birds offered diets containing wheat A generated the greatest starch digestibility coefficient in the jejunum and ileum in both starter and finisher diets and red sorghum outperformed white sorghum in terms of AME and starch digestibility. In the ileum, broiler chickens offered finisher diets based on wheat B had the highest protein digestibility. In conclusion, birds offered maize-based diets achieved the best growth performance and energy utilisation followed by birds offered wheat- and sorghum-based diets.",

A total of 900 male broilers were allocated into 60 pens. In phase 1, dietary treatments were high (H, 9.6 g/kg Ca and 4.8 g/kg NPP), moderate (M, 7.6 g/kg Ca and 3.8 g/kg NPP), low (L, 5.6 g/kg Ca and 2.8 g/kg NPP) and very low (VL, 3.6 g/kg Ca and 1.8 g/kg) level of Ca and NPP. H and M diets showed higher average daily feed intake (ADFI) and serum Ca than those of L and VL diets. There was a linear decrease in tibia Ca and serum P and a linear increase in relative expression of SLC20A1 and CALB1 and retention of Ca and P when concentration of Ca and NPP was reduced. H diet resulted in the highest tarsometatarsus strength and feed conversion ratio (FCR). M and L diets showed higher average daily gain (ADG) than those of H and VL diets. VL diet demonstrated the lowest tibia ash. On day 25, treatments H, M, L and VL received, respectively, 4, 3, 2 and 1 types of finisher diets (H, M, L and VL) during phase 2, resulting in a total of 10 treatments; HH, HM, HL, HVL, MM, ML, MVL, LL, LVL and VLVL. HH vs. HM vs. HL vs. HVL showed a linear decrease of ADFI, ADG, serum P, tibia ash, tarsometatarsus strength and a linear increase of FCR. HH vs. MM vs. LL vs. VLVL demonstrated a linear increase of relative expression of CALB1 and SLC20A1 and a linear decrease of serum P, and in terms of growth performance, MM showed the best results generally. MM vs. ML vs. MVL showed a linear decrease of ADFI and ADG and a linear increase of FCR. HM vs. ML vs. LVL demonstrated a linear decrease of ADG, serum Ca and P and relative expression of CALB1 and a linear increase of FCR (during phase 2). In conclusion, reducing Ca and NPP level over finisher phase, similarly for all combinations of treatments, resulted in poorer performance either in finisher phase or the whole period. Generally, 7.6 g/kg Ca and 3.8 g/kg NPP over the whole period maximized broiler’s performance without negative effects on bone ash and strength.",

        "abstract": "Irrational usage of antibiotic feed additives in livestock industry, especially as growth promoters, has become a global challenge due to the unintended zoonotic impact through resistance transfer. Herbal plant extracts or their secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties may possess similar effects of various antibiotic feed additives in impeding the pathogenic microbial growth and enhancing the health, growth, and production performance. Majority of the calf-plant extract associated research works were primarily geared towards phenolic compounds and essential oils, with a few related to terpenes, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, organic acids, complex carbohydrates, and non-protein amino acids. The plant secondary metabolites possess diverse antimicrobial mechanisms, including cell membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, substrate deprivation, and prevention of bacterial colonization, to name a few. Further, the unification of different levels and types of plant metabolites before supplementing to calves renders synergistic effects, which aids in several beneficial responses such as increased bioavailability, improved efficiency, and reduced undesirable effects and effective dosage. Nevertheless, the employment of herbal extracts or plant metabolites as antimicrobial feed additives to calves retain many challenges regarding the dosages, levels, adaptation lengths, herbal or herb-drug interactions, analytical methods, and public health safety. The present review focuses on assembling existing data on the plant-based antimicrobial components, individual secondary plant metabolites or plant extracts, which are already in use or having the efficacy in benefitting calves on supplementation",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA) fed alone or in association with a Cr methionine complex (CrMet) on the performance and meat quality of Nellore cattle finished in a feedlot. Three hundred thirty-six Nellore bulls were blocked by body weight (BW; 342 ± 24.5 kg) and assigned to one of the following three dietary treatments: a control diet containing 54 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source of minerals (CON); a diet providing 21.6 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source with 32.4 mg/kg of a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA); and a diet providing 21.6 mg/kg of Zn from an inorganic source with 32.4 mg/kg of a Zn amino acid complex combined with 0.36 mg/kg of a CrMet complex (ZnCr). The total number of days on the diets was 130 days, with an initial 35-d period for dietary acclimation to the finishing diet. Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with the pen as the experimental unit (36 pens). Blood parameters and meat quality were analyzed as repeated measures (from 72 animals; 2 animals/pen). The final BW, dry matter intake (DMI), and average daily gain (ADG) was similar among the treatments (P ≥ 0.261). The overall mean DMI, final BW, and ADG were 9.15 kg/d, 535 kg, and 1.49 kg/d, respectively. Feeding ZnCr improved efficiency (P = 0.011) compared with the ZnAA and CON bulls. Leucocytes, aminotransferase, β-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, glucose, and cortisol were affected (P ≤ 0.038) by time but not by dietary treatment. Flight speed and serum cortisol level were unaffected (P ≥ 0.518) by dietary treatment. No significant treatment effects (P ≥ 0.169) were detected for hot carcass weight, fat, pH, temperature, liver, kidney, or KPH. Treatment tended to alter the area of the Longissimus muscle (P = 0.081). The Longissimus muscle area was greater for bulls fed ZnCr than for bulls fed ZnAA or CON (80.6 vs. 77.5 cm2). There was a tendency (P = 0.073) for decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force in animals fed ZnCr. Tenderness was improved by 12.3 % compared with CON. Individual fatty acids (P ≥ 0.171) and total fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated; P ≥ 0.392) did not differ among the treatments. These data suggest that finishing Nellore bulls fed ZnCr in a feedlot setting exhibited greater efficiency and tended to exhibit improved meat tenderness compared with bulls fed ZnAA.",

        "abstract": "Mao-tofu is traditionally coagulated by natural fermented tofu sour water (NFTSW), which contains large numbers of microorganisms from the environment. Nonetheless, the microorganisms accountable for coagulation require further analysis and characterization. Our aim was to evaluate the bacteria in NFTSW that carry out the traditional fermentation process of Mao-tofu by using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results show that Lactobacillus ultunensis, Enterococcus bulliens, Lactobacillus graminis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus mucosae are the primary bacteria involved in brewing. Furthermore, 6 types of lactic acid bacteria were sequestered from NFTSW by methodology dependent on culture and their acid-producing abilities were analyzed. The results indicated that strain L1, which was identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, produced the highest lactic acid content of 2.85 g/100 mL. Simulated coagulation further confirmed that strain L1 was preferable for Mao-tofu coagulation through the evaluation of textural properties, volatile flavour compounds, and sensory characteristics. The results suggested that Lactobacillus delbrueckii might be the core functional microorganism significantly contributing to flavor compound synthesis during the traditional production of Chinese Huizhou Mao-tofu. The research method we used in this investigation may encourage detection of the main microorganisms with different roles involved in other food fermentation processes.",

        "abstract": "The fates of clomazone, fomesafen, and quizalofop-p-ethyl and its metabolite quizalofop (acid) in soybean samples during tofu processing were systematically assessed. Residues were determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) after each processing step, including washing, soaking, grinding and filtering, cooking, coagulating, and squeezing. The pesticide distribution at each step of the process was studied, and pesticide processing factors were calculated. Differences in the pesticide residue levels were found at each processing step. Changes in pesticide residues in the tofu products was closely related to their physicochemical properties such as octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), water solubility, and vapor pressure. The results showed that soaking prominently decreased fomesafen residues by 72.0%, as indicated by its high water-solubility and low log Kow. Grinding and filtering reduced pesticide residues by 88.8%–94.8%, mainly due to dilution or okara separation. The processing factors were generally <1 for each step and for the entire process, except those for cooking, coagulating, and squeezing. These results demonstrated that the overall process could significantly reduce clomazone, fomesafen, quizalofop-p-ethyl, quizalofop (acid) residues during tofu processing.",

        "title": "Effects of orthodontic tooth extrusion produced by different techniques, on the periodontal tissues: a histological study in dogs",
        "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the periodontal tissue changes resulting from different methods of orthodontic tooth extrusion in dogs. Materials and methods: Notches were surgically prepared in the root surface at the bone crest level of the first premolars of mongrel dogs. After 37 days, extrusion of the first lower and upper premolars was randomly performed by 3 different methods: conventional orthodontic extrusion (OE); open flap debridement performed immediately before orthodontic extrusion (OF); and orthodontic extrusion associated with weekly fiberotomy and scaling (FS). For all groups, extrusion was performed for 21 days followed by one-month retention and sacrifice. Periodontal parameters, descriptive histology, and histomorphometric analyses were performed at the end of the experimental period. Results: The median extrusion was 2.25 in the fiberotomy group, 2.0 mm in the open flap group and 1.0 mm in the orthodontic extrusion group with no significant differences between groups. The highest distance between reference notch and bone crest was observed in the fiberotomy group (p < 0.05). Histologically, radicular resorption repaired with cellular cementum was detected in all groups. Conclusions: Tooth extrusion was successfully achieved with all of the different methods of orthodontic tooth extrusion with no statistical significance between techniques. The fiberotomy approach was effective in avoiding coronal displacement of periodontal tissues. Fiberotomy associated with scaling should be indicated if the objective of the treatment is extrusion without periodontal tissue displacement.",

        "title": "Performance comparison of dome and basket extrusion granulation",
        "abstract": "A water dispersible granule (WG) formulation is a dry, solid formulation containing active ingredients intended to be diluted/dispersed in water prior to application. If the co-formulants are properly selected, WGs typically have desirable physical and chemical stability. In addition, storage and transport of dry formulations are inherently easier than liquid formulation types. WG formulations of agricultural products offer the added advantage of low dust and safer handling compared to wettable powders (WP).\n\nWG formulations can be prepared via several types of granulation processes, with paste extrusion being the most common in crop protection products. Granules created by paste extrusion generally offer improved resistance to attrition, and higher and more consistent bulk density compared to WP formulations. Rapid and complete dispersion in a variety of water conditions is a key performance parameters used to evaluate WG formulations.\n\nAmong common paste extrusion methods, basket and dome extrusion are the two widely used techniques. Basket extrusion is thought to be less process sensitive. Historically, products originally designed to be dome extruded can often be basket extruded, but not vice versa. In this work, milled powder premixes of varying water solubility are paste extruded using these two technologies. The paste extrudates are dried using a lab scale vibratory fluidized bed. The products are compared based on measured performance quality criteria including dispersion, bulk density, suspensibility, wet sieve, and moisture sorption. Additionally, microscopic characterizations proved valuable in elucidating certain performance differences.",

        "title": "Extrusion of the biodegradable ZnMg0.8Ca0.2 alloy – The influence of extrusion parameters on microstructure and mechanical characteristics",
        "abstract": "The Zn-based alloys, alloyed with the elements of the 2nd group of the periodic table, are considered as potential biodegradable materials suitable for the fabrication of small orthopaedic implants or cardiovascular stents. Unfortunately, the as-cast Zn-based alloys do not fulfil the requirements for mechanical properties for such applications. Extrusion is a thermomechanical process which is very powerful for breaking the cast microstructure and enhancing mechanical characteristics of metallic materials. In this study, we focused on the influence of extrusion parameters, such as temperature and extrusion ratio, on microstructural and mechanical characteristics of a ZnMg0.8Ca0.2 (wt.%) alloy. The extrusion led to a significant grain refinement and the formation of a crystallographic texture. Extrusion temperature played a more significant role in the mean grain size compared to the extrusion ratio (ER). At lower extrusion temperatures, the texture was less intensive and the subsequent mechanical anisotropy was weaker. Constants for the prediction of the grain size based on the ZenerHollomon parameter were obtained. Prediction of mechanical properties using the Hall-Petch relationship appeared to be difficult because of the dependence of the texture on the extrusion temperature. Extrusion at the temperatures of 200 �C (ER ¼ 25:1) and 150 �C (ER ¼ 11:1) led to mechanical performance fulfilling the requirements for implantology.",
